neg/cv840_18033.txt  " idle hands " is distasteful , crass and derivative . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt that is the level of this's atrocity's humor . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the movie treats death as a joke . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt  " idle hands " is gruesome and morbid . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today's young people and their values in a satiric vein . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt however , it's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt with the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt  " idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt the time is not right for this type of movie . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right . 
neg/cv840_18033.txt this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .

neg/cv882_10042.txt seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
neg/cv882_10042.txt there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ? 
neg/cv882_10042.txt he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! 
neg/cv882_10042.txt wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there's no rules about jumping too high . " 
neg/cv882_10042.txt  " predictable " doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt it's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human . 
neg/cv882_10042.txt but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .

neg/cv411_16799.txt confucius once said , " governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . " 
neg/cv411_16799.txt his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company's payroll . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . 
neg/cv411_16799.txt a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .

neg/cv119_9909.txt  . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt  . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so ! 
neg/cv119_9909.txt i've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does ! 
neg/cv119_9909.txt it's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt when the plot finally gets underway , there's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt the frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt franklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt james offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt as expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience . 
neg/cv119_9909.txt frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money .

neg/cv349_15032.txt what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .

neg/cv378_21982.txt

neg/cv378_21982.txt it should have been a classic . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt a great cast of respected supporting actors . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt an interesting premise of loser comic book characters . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt however , " mystery men " proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt  " mystery men " might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt another major problem with " mystery men " is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of " american pie " and " there's something about mary . " 
neg/cv378_21982.txt  " mystery men " drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt so why continue to watch ? 
neg/cv378_21982.txt this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt  " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! " 
neg/cv378_21982.txt  " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt  " i'm unpredictable ! " 
neg/cv378_21982.txt an overexcited ben stiller shouts out . 
neg/cv378_21982.txt no ben , you're the complete opposite .

neg/cv070_13249.txt they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .

neg/cv070_13249.txt bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt why an oil driller ? 
neg/cv070_13249.txt they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt  ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
neg/cv070_13249.txt hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) 
neg/cv070_13249.txt harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt nor will you care . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt  " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
neg/cv070_13249.txt rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
neg/cv070_13249.txt his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt  ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) 
neg/cv070_13249.txt whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! " 
neg/cv070_13249.txt i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt it has a vivid soundmix . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt bollocks ! 
neg/cv070_13249.txt the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt remember a little film called jaws ? 
neg/cv070_13249.txt in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . 
neg/cv070_13249.txt and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

neg/cv431_7538.txt did we attend the same movie ? ! 
neg/cv431_7538.txt at 87 minutes it seemed overlong , like a snl skit on steroids , and at any length it seemed unfunny . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt yes , the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills , and yes , the concept , dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon ( played by myers ) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy ( dr . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt evil , also played by myers ) in the present day , had a great deal of potential . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt don't get me wrong , i like a good " bubbles in the bathtub joke " as much as the next person , but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt but , the way things work these days in the movie business , all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it . 
neg/cv431_7538.txt i do give this film stars because of the sets , costumes , and sadly , unmet potential .

neg/cv005_29357.txt capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt  , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal " desolation " williams . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 . 
neg/cv005_29357.txt her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . 


neg/cv619_13677.txt

neg/cv619_13677.txt sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's a suspense film with no suspense . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally " explained . " 
neg/cv619_13677.txt there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt the doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt for instance , he points to the " nerds , " who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , " bite me ! " 
neg/cv619_13677.txt anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt the acting is largely a waste of talent . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . 
neg/cv619_13677.txt so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .
