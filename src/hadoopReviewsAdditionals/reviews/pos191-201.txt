pos/cv651_10492.txt it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as " raising arizona " and " the hudsucker proxy , " made their feature film debut with " blood simple , " a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent " fargo , " but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; " blood simple " is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt the premise of " blood simple " is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the " big picture " and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt the coens might have done well to title the film " fear and loathing in texas . " 
pos/cv651_10492.txt some have labeled " blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt that said , " blood simple " is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt that said , " blood simple " is not exactly flawless . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt  " blood simple " is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . 
pos/cv651_10492.txt i would firmly recommend it to all " coen-heads " as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller .

pos/cv451_10690.txt trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt  ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt denise crosby , who played tasha yar on " star trek : the next generation , " serves as the host . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt  ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the " new yorker " as the first recorded usage of the word . ) 
pos/cv451_10690.txt unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt  " every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , " she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt  " i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , " she reminds us . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt these people are having the time of their lives . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt  ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the " q virus . " 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt he says his patients like it . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt he fits right in . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . 
pos/cv451_10690.txt it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .

pos/cv639_10308.txt the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
pos/cv639_10308.txt where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the " talking villains , " blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
pos/cv639_10308.txt i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt and " tomorrow never dies , " the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt thank god ! 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt no , this is not " wag the dog " - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in 
pos/cv639_10308.txt comes bond . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and 
pos/cv639_10308.txt co-star of " supercop , " nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt thank god again . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt oh well . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in " from russia with love " -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in " goldeneye , " joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt again , oh well . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the 
pos/cv639_10308.txt plot's not really essential ) . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt they're more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the acting , from most around is great . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she's so unique . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of " on her majesty's secret service " only to be killed , added some emotional depth . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt and brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they're so fun and add to the escapism . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt if you can remember the dalton years , and they're serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt i don't really understand it myself , yet i'm one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt having seen all of them more than once ( yes , i've seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . 
pos/cv639_10308.txt while it's not one of the best , like " goldfinger " or " from russia with love , " " tomorrow never dies " is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . 


pos/cv377_7946.txt

pos/cv377_7946.txt full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt hartman . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt hartman , continues on . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt that is , until sgt . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt hartman comes up with a new plan . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . 
pos/cv377_7946.txt unfortunately , many did . 


pos/cv742_7751.txt

pos/cv742_7751.txt the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say " birdy num-num " ? ) . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party . 
pos/cv742_7751.txt it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party . 


pos/cv829_20289.txt

pos/cv829_20289.txt albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt while this may not be his finest work , " the muse " still shakes up some delightful humor . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? 
pos/cv829_20289.txt the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt she wasn't likeable at all . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because " the muse " had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt the funniest moments in " the muse " in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt it was just plain hilarious . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt brilliant move by brooks . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt  " bowfinger " had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but " the muse " still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort . 
pos/cv829_20289.txt i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .

pos/cv787_13743.txt if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in " i went down . " 
pos/cv787_13743.txt gleeson , who's not dissimilar to the late " saturday night live " alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt bunny is sent to county cork to " retrieve " one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle ) . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt bunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt that tom french is a mean bollocks . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt he wants frank back . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt and a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom's wife was supposed to have given to frank . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt for this he won't break anyone's thumbs . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt maybe . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , " i went down " follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , " the butcher boy . " 
pos/cv787_13743.txt even if you can't comprehend half of what they're saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make " i went down " a trip worth taking . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt the film is in many ways reminiscent of another " little " independent feature , 1991's " highway 61 . " 
pos/cv787_13743.txt that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in " highway 61 . " 
pos/cv787_13743.txt what's also charming about " i went down " is how the relationship between buddy and git develops . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it's handled is neither sappy nor labored . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt it's a little too hollywood , and what makes " i went down " so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt sure it's gritty--make that grubby--but it's also pretty goofy . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt although " i went down " emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt don't let these deter you , though ; " i went down " is a little gem . 
pos/cv787_13743.txt it's only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won't be there for long--so catch it while you can .

pos/cv099_10534.txt call it touched by a demon . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt  ( remember bob ? ) 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around . " 
pos/cv099_10534.txt shortly thereafter , he begins to sing " time is on my side " as he's taken on his last walk . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt shadows and night scenes abound . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the days are cloudy and unpromising . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . 
pos/cv099_10534.txt and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . 


pos/cv723_8648.txt

pos/cv723_8648.txt director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt you need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt speed 2 is no exception . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt this time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt yep , that's right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt speaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt the reason for this act of destruction is revenge . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt naturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt thinking back on this film , you can't help , but admire it's structure . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt the way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt the race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt  ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . ) 
pos/cv723_8648.txt simple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt the acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt overall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt not up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same . 
pos/cv723_8648.txt there is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie .

pos/cv996_11592.txt richard gere can be a commanding actor , but he's not always in great films . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt everything comes together here . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt it doesn't go exactly as he expects . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt gere's client , aaron ( edward norton ) , is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt the evidence is stacked against him . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop's blood . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt he has a relationship with the priest . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt gere talks to the boy , believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt despite the lawyer's proclamations that he doesn't care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people's lives , he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt lots of complications and twists . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt the prosecuting attorney is gere's former co-worker and lover . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt they both work each other's motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt gere's case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt gere is exceptional as the well-dressed reserved counselor , but just once , i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his " suit " persona . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt even when he loses it , you don't see very far inside . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt norton's aaron is convincing : he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt as with most of the effective courtroom dramas , the cinematography is crisp and rich . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt the story will keep you on the edge of your seat . 
pos/cv996_11592.txt nothing is what it seems .
