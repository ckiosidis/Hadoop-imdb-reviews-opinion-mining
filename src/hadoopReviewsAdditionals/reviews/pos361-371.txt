pos/cv281_23253.txt while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt both films consist of a predominately male cast . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt it doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . 
pos/cv281_23253.txt otherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . 


pos/cv486_9799.txt

pos/cv486_9799.txt every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he's not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt not to mention an expensive one . ) 
pos/cv486_9799.txt sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt and boy , did he take that route ! 
pos/cv486_9799.txt i'd say at about 165 mph or so . . . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically " hibernated " herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt unfortunately , she thought she'd only be out for a couple of weeks . . . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by " the company " , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an " alien advisor " . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt it doesn't exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say " big mistake " , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you're literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt well , they would be wrong , my friends . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt if this film had no " drama " , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? 
pos/cv486_9799.txt that's right , best actress . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt in short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt then again , maybe not . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt movies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it's throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt so who will be the next king ? 
pos/cv486_9799.txt well , let's wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . 
pos/cv486_9799.txt i can't wait . 


pos/cv297_10047.txt

pos/cv297_10047.txt 1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt what could be next ? 
pos/cv297_10047.txt whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . 
pos/cv297_10047.txt that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 


pos/cv182_7281.txt

pos/cv182_7281.txt the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt yet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt shue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt the saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . 
pos/cv182_7281.txt all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . 


pos/cv641_12349.txt

pos/cv641_12349.txt john sayles' " men with guns " is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt the film's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , " because they had guns , and we didn't . " 
pos/cv641_12349.txt rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in " men with guns . " 
pos/cv641_12349.txt  ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) 
pos/cv641_12349.txt he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn't ) . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in " matewan " ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in " lone star " ( 1996 ) . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( " gattaca " ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt it would not be a stretch to say that " men with guns " is a depressing film . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . 
pos/cv641_12349.txt the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , " nobody refuses the men with guns . "

pos/cv270_6079.txt this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt there is marc renton ( who narrates ) , spud ( the dim-witted one ) sick boy ( the sean connery obsessive ) , and begbee ( the violence obsessive ) . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt powered by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggy pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed . . . ) the film follows renton who gets clean , gets back into heroin and gets clean again . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction-esque , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheets ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film starts out on a comic note , it takes a sharp term in the middle , and becomes almost depressing . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4 . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt this is a very original film , as far as films go today . 
pos/cv270_6079.txt it definetly deserves multiple viewings ( partly because of the slang and accents ) jeremy dennison mr . orange@centuryinter . net

pos/cv352_5524.txt carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt action and science fiction just don't get any better than this ! 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt now the people who did it are after him . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt it grabs you and never lets go ! 
pos/cv352_5524.txt this film is a winner from beginning to end . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the action and stunts are terrific . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! 
pos/cv352_5524.txt the visuals had such a state of the art " slickness " that they won an oscar . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . 
pos/cv352_5524.txt who cares ? 
pos/cv352_5524.txt it's a movie .

pos/cv422_9381.txt

pos/cv422_9381.txt billed as a " feminist sex fantasy " , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a " her " - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of " boogie nights " , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt the other performances are equally solid . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt at one point , the title character declares that " instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work " . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt it's funny , sexy and subversive . 
pos/cv422_9381.txt and it shouldn't be missed .

pos/cv856_29013.txt my filmcritic . com 
pos/cv856_29013.txt colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e . , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt in a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt is boyish , eccentric " sam deed from dubuque , iowa " a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ? 
pos/cv856_29013.txt as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt the question proves to be moot , at least for a time . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : " he's a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! " 
pos/cv856_29013.txt neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn't quite sure how to handle " sam deed " when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt  ( don't ask . ) 
pos/cv856_29013.txt it's all a bit much to take in . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt who ya gonna believe ? 
pos/cv856_29013.txt despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear " cute " to her adoring fans . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal " substantial and sexy . " 
pos/cv856_29013.txt it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt then there's that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt look , this stuff is purely subjective . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams' hyperactive schtick . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt for my money , it's m . tomei with a bullet . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker's la jetee , especially with those still framed " memory " photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan's run . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt as the stranger in a strange land , d'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) 
pos/cv856_29013.txt at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts " sam deed " to the ultimate test . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt  ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) 
pos/cv856_29013.txt there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy . 
pos/cv856_29013.txt the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots , commercials included .
