neg/cv366_10709.txt synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt strike two came while the previews played . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? 
neg/cv366_10709.txt well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt but , then again , what do i know about business ? 
neg/cv366_10709.txt i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't . 
neg/cv366_10709.txt make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery .

neg/cv871_25971.txt paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt but why ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt the kind who just won't die . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( " i've lost cohesion again ! " ) . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt bush referring to clinton ; " ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt to what end ? " -- 
neg/cv871_25971.txt this actually got applause ! 
neg/cv871_25971.txt suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) 
neg/cv871_25971.txt begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than " audiences will pay for anything these days " . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt verhoeven delivers the sleazy " goods " , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt  " are you looking at me ? " , she queries , obviously haunted . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt you've been warned . 
neg/cv871_25971.txt but you probably won't listen , will you ? 
neg/cv871_25971.txt tis' a pity ? ? ? 


neg/cv661_25780.txt

neg/cv661_25780.txt i have a confession . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt even though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i've never seen any of the original godzillas . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt  ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; it's the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . ) 
neg/cv661_25780.txt so , part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt this was a long-awaited treat . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt i was expecting a goofy good time , complete with bad dubbing , science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt you do get all of the " so bad they're good " traits so normally associated with the franchise . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt it's a deal i wasn't willing to accept . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura's script crams in way too many details , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt the maneuver is not only disconcerting , but gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt was it a whim ? 
neg/cv661_25780.txt a bold political statement ? 
neg/cv661_25780.txt i don't know . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt its foe , an ancient meteor that looks like prudential's logo , doesn't just fight the beast from the far east . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt no , it's got to have life-saving powers , a plot to erase " the data " from japan , a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt there's a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit ( takehiro murata ) and a slimy government official ( hiroshi abe ) over the handling of godzilla , and personal issues . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt and then there's the plucky news photographer and blah , blah , blah . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt it's like watching magnolia all over again-except without the good writing , keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt what a waste . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you , godzilla 2000 does the job-it's entertaining and goes down easy . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt the dubbing is nice and awful , with murata sounding like he's in constant need of a cough drop . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt as for the dialogue , one line summarizes the goofiness factor : " did anyone see that flying rock go by ? " 
neg/cv661_25780.txt this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i've heard the word " imbecile " used in casual conversation . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments , i wouldn't take kids to see it . 
neg/cv661_25780.txt they'll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose . 


neg/cv775_17966.txt

neg/cv775_17966.txt sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has " hip comedy " written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing " you have to be joking " situations . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt etc . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt in " pushing tin , " thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , " quirky " credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for " the full monty , " let alone won it . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick " the zone " falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt of course . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt oh no . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? 
neg/cv775_17966.txt director mike newell ( " four weddings and a funeral " ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt they'll make you frown in disbelief . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt they'll have you constantly looking at your watch . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt but wait ! 
neg/cv775_17966.txt there's still 100 minutes to go ! ! 
neg/cv775_17966.txt the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( " oscar and lucinda " ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( " elizabeth " ) . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt but she's not enough to save the picture . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt but it's too little too late . 
neg/cv775_17966.txt a fine cast aside , " pushing tin " is nothing more than an embarrassment . 


neg/cv470_17444.txt

neg/cv470_17444.txt i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt if there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt you see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ? 
neg/cv470_17444.txt that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt i've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt it has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt obviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt the three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt of the three , only danes has a real character . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt ribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt when the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt all kinds of good stuff ! 
neg/cv470_17444.txt the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt epps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt a drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt claire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt she could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt the mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt it's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt claire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt there are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt do not be fooled . 
neg/cv470_17444.txt some may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare .

neg/cv852_27512.txt reviewed by dennis schwartz 
neg/cv852_27512.txt a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat , so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain , almost as valued a commodity . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt an ex-circus clown named louison ( dominique pinon ) , the film's too-good-to-be-true hero , answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet ( jean-claude dreyfus ) , and the butcher and landlord , offers him room and board in his house . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the butcher's clumsy and near-sighted daughter julie ( marie-laure dougnac ) falls in love with the skinny , weird looking clown , and the two make some music together , with her playing the cello and him a saw . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt they are the innocents , surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father , who has lured into his tenement the clown , as he has his past innocent victims , so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat , which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt there are two youngsters ( boban janevski & mikael todde ) who do any kind of mischief they can . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt a frog man ( howard vernon ) who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt two brothers ( mathou & kube ) who create little cow-moo novelty toys . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt a man ( holgado ) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt a slutty woman ( karin viard ) , who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the aristocratic woman ( silvie laguna ) who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what the butcher is up to , so they are forced to communicate with each other through a pipe that runs through the building ( in one scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal , as their bedsprings squeak ) . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt there is also a sex-crazed postman ( chick ortega ) , who lusts for the butcher's daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics , called trogolodistes , who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics , as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity . 
neg/cv852_27512.txt delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin , monty python fans , and those who liked terry gilliam's brazil , a film similar in spirit . 


neg/cv351_17029.txt

neg/cv351_17029.txt there's a scene early on in " jawbreaker " where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , " that is * so * not funny " . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt how right she was . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt or fun . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt or original . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt not content with the too-obvious " heathers " heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including " carrie " , " bride of frankenstein " , " blue velvet " , and even shaw's pygmalion , itself recently remade as " she's all that " . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt  " jawbreaker " is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt's " volcano girls " ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're watching . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt rebecca gayheart , following roles in " scream 2 " and " urban legend " , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino's " jackie brown " . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt and rose mcgowan should just quit acting . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the " real " actors are doing . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ? 
neg/cv351_17029.txt that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt stylistically , thematically & narratively , " jawbreaker " is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt he's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt  " jawbreaker " is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i've ever seen . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt to call " jawbreaker " garbage would be to insult garbage . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i've already got my pick for worst film of '99 . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt  " jawbreaker " runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than " titanic " , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence . 
neg/cv351_17029.txt not recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else .

neg/cv471_18405.txt when the mediums in question are video game and feature film , has there ever been a respective here-to-there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle-headed mediocrity ? 
neg/cv471_18405.txt  " super mario bros . , " " street fighter " and " mortal kombat " were silly stinkers all , and now the empty , execrable " wing commander " joins their lowly ranks . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci-fi , easily the worst of its kind , is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - that is to say , there's little fun to be had when you're not the one holding the joystick . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt the movie , then , is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts , who created the original , groundbreaking pc incarnation of " wing commander " back in 1990 . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head-scratcher . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt  " wing commander " 's story , credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney , is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt it rips off the finest films of its genre , top gun and , in one scene , even those spiffy " stereoscopic freeze " gap commercials . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt set in 2654 , " wing commander " stars freddie prinze jr . as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt along the way , he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior ( saffron burrows ) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted , comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his " pilgrim " heritage ( don't ask ) , and goes on a top-secret mission involving the " jump coordinates " ( what , no death star plans ? ) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt or something like that . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt given the immensely confusing activity , it's hard to tell . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt on the other hand , what's easy to see is that " wing commander " is a big old mess . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt the lame dialogue strains , filled with such original lines as " don't you die on me ! " , 
neg/cv471_18405.txt  " battle stations ! " 
neg/cv471_18405.txt and repeated ( and frequently unanswered ) calls for a " medic ! " 
neg/cv471_18405.txt action sequences fizzle . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt the character conflict garners unintentional giggles . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like , as they're kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a ? 50s roger corman cheapie and you've got a good idea . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt little but techno-babble happens for an hour , and then it's as if " wing commander " tries to do too much at once ; when it appears as though the movie's about to show signs of a pulse , it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt matthew lillard , featured prominently in said sequence , is cast as prinze's hotshot partner , and though the two are fine young actors - recently paired in the hit " she's all that " - they're fighting more than otherworldly evil here . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt rumor has it that " wing commander " was slated as a later-in-the-year release , bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new " star wars : episode i " trailer . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt but in my audience , there were no females present to make goo-goo eyes at prinze or lillard , and many a member exited after the much-ballyhooed sneak peek . 
neg/cv471_18405.txt since most cineplexes won't be granting refunds to the latter contingency , " commander " might rake in some dough , but be warned : the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation .

neg/cv865_28796.txt one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ? 
neg/cv865_28796.txt the addiction is that movie . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill " relationship " with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model . ) 
neg/cv865_28796.txt matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt no kidding . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full " dirty ol' man " mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt wider ! ) 
neg/cv865_28796.txt toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits .

neg/cv865_28796.txt dirty old sod . ) 
neg/cv865_28796.txt it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt how's that for cryptic ? 
neg/cv865_28796.txt never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt i can picture it now . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt  " take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id .

neg/cv865_28796.txt yeah , you , ferrara . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt a final word about matthew modine : he's actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt he's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt [he was in that scene ? 
neg/cv865_28796.txt -ed . ] 
neg/cv865_28796.txt here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt better luck next time , matt . 
neg/cv865_28796.txt someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place .
