neg/cv727_5006.txt girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt if there was a point to the film , i missed it . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt he should have stuck to acting in this film . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt in that film , they worked to propel the narrative . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt in this film , they just made me more confused . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt other than that , though , nothing much happens . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt in girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt he had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . 
neg/cv727_5006.txt girl 6 earns a grade of d .

neg/cv677_18938.txt a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one .

neg/cv677_18938.txt welcome to my review of the general's daughter . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder .

neg/cv677_18938.txt this film is just there . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt get the picture ? 
neg/cv677_18938.txt i sure did . . . it's 
neg/cv677_18938.txt too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt easy as pie . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . ) 
neg/cv677_18938.txt woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt it's like riding a bike . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually " breaking down " to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the " best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott " ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director .

neg/cv677_18938.txt see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .

neg/cv677_18938.txt you'll feel much better afterwards . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt trust me .

neg/cv677_18938.txt john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis' home . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt director simon west's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) . 
neg/cv677_18938.txt before that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants .

neg/cv677_18938.txt veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) ,

neg/cv248_15672.txt vampire's is a rude , chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse , present only to pleasure men , feed vampires , readied to be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt to make matters worse , the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks , and deserve to have their heads bitten off , if not , their bodies carved in half . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt the dilemma of hating the ? heroes' as much as the ? villains' , makes one wish that the ? hand of god' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt james wood portrays jack crow , a man obsessed with killing vampires , whose soul reason for living is based on revenge ( they killed his parents ) , but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt as for adam baldwin , he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts ? action' , and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt as for the claims that the catholic church created ? dracula' , well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion , outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury , with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame . 
neg/cv248_15672.txt an awful movie on all counts , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent , rude vampire slayers .

neg/cv227_25406.txt the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze .

neg/cv227_25406.txt hmmmm . . wonder 
neg/cv227_25406.txt what memphis is doing ? 
neg/cv227_25406.txt in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away .

neg/cv227_25406.txt shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family .

neg/cv227_25406.txt raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? 
neg/cv227_25406.txt can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? 
neg/cv227_25406.txt i'll bet you can . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt looks like everything might turn out alright after all . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt or maybe it's just the cars . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt too bad his minutes onscreen are so few . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt imagine the yuks . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt the ramifications are never explored . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt not only is it stupid , but it's against the law . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along . 
neg/cv227_25406.txt gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory .

neg/cv895_22200.txt 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt i'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt while the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt james spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt you know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt even if they are both gorgeous . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again . 
neg/cv895_22200.txt or at least not all of it anyway .

neg/cv457_19546.txt lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " a clockwork orange , " " lolita , " and " dr . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb . " 
neg/cv457_19546.txt now , sadly , he's added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler's 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt he has confused profundity with pretentiousness . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt pollack , the director of such box-office hits as " tootsie " and " out of africa , " is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth . . . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt and there isn't much depth to begin with ! 
neg/cv457_19546.txt unhappily , there's not likely to be a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt it doesn't help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt cruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt he's a doctor and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who's singularly determined to get her in the sack .

neg/cv457_19546.txt back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice's aggressive jealousy kicks in . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt as retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt it's all way too much for him . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt for revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt then he almost does the hooker's roommate . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt and he's almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and " the women are incredible " ( i . e . , naked ) . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt this " erotic " set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it's a lot less shocking than it's intended to be . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt what's the big deal ? 
neg/cv457_19546.txt bill doesn't exactly * do * anything ( other than throw his money and credentials around ) , and alice only ever lusted in her heart . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt whoop-dee-doo . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt still , they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace--was kubrick , notorious for multiple takes , paying them at an hourly rate ? 
neg/cv457_19546.txt even geniuses have their bad days . 
neg/cv457_19546.txt  " eyes wide shut " just happens to be kubrick's bad day , an unerotic , disappointing , and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career .

neg/cv468_16844.txt they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt the film's dialog not only isn't funny , it's trite . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt one nerdy young girl introduces herself with " my name is fern mayo , as in hold the mayo . " 
neg/cv468_16844.txt when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she can't refuse -- make-up ! 
neg/cv468_16844.txt they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt the teachers fare no better , especially in the ridiculous lines they are given . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt  " miss shayne , please cover your bosom , " one young teacher , who has been made up to look old and ugly , says without any conviction . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt  " this is a learning institution , not a brothel . " 
neg/cv468_16844.txt besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made , there is one other question that i'd like to ask the director . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ? 
neg/cv468_16844.txt in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz's murder . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex . 
neg/cv468_16844.txt i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .

neg/cv189_24248.txt  " houston . we have a serious problem . " 
neg/cv189_24248.txt after making " mission : impossible " , brian de palma has a lot to live up to . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from " apollo 13 " , de palma slowly builds up his " story " . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt the human race has already set foot on mars . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt this is basically the whole plot . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt but de palma manages to do that . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt it is not a very good achievement . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's " 2001 : a space odyssey " , " apollo 13 " and " godzilla " . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt to make time pass , the creators have inserted several " refreshing " scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt when it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt i can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt sometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this " constantly surprising " tour you'll see -- an alien . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but " lost in space " is actually better . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt that's an achievement in itself ! 
neg/cv189_24248.txt director brian de palma has stroke gold with " untouchables " that became an instant american classic . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt he'll live to fight another day ! 
neg/cv189_24248.txt i send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt unfortunately their hard work was in vain . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film . 
neg/cv189_24248.txt if you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor .

neg/cv436_20564.txt chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt that would be pretty nasty . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt this proves to be tricky . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt take the villains , for example . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' 
neg/cv436_20564.txt this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt and i did chuckle a few times . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt `you own this place ? ' 
neg/cv436_20564.txt the general asks . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt `yeah , ' ulrich says . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt `they call me darlene . ' 
neg/cv436_20564.txt these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . 
neg/cv436_20564.txt sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been .

neg/cv757_10668.txt one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt  " so , are we all going to die ? " 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . 's dark and ugly cinematography . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt coming to their " rescue " is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the show has a single , but unprintable , good line . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the show concludes with a sickening set of twists . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt hard rain runs 1 : 37 . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers . 
neg/cv757_10668.txt  ( the two families behind us shockingly had a half-dozen preschoolers among them . )
