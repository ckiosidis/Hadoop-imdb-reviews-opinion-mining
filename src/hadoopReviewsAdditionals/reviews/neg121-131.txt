neg/cv676_22202.txt bad . bad . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt bad . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
neg/cv676_22202.txt still haven't got the point ? 
neg/cv676_22202.txt other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt this movie stinks out loud . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt quite frankly , this movie deserves a . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt so i'm giving it a . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt and maybe that is too generous . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt so what is this movie about ? 
neg/cv676_22202.txt you ask . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt like it really matters . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt ok , here goes . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of " hey man " , " dig " and my all time favorite -- " this is my happening , and it freaks me out " . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? 
neg/cv676_22202.txt ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt then we have the cast . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . 
neg/cv676_22202.txt proceed with extreme caution . 


neg/cv321_14191.txt

neg/cv321_14191.txt studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? 
neg/cv321_14191.txt  " 54 " belongs in the elite group of films known as " the big disappointments " : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt i was heavily awaiting " 54 , " not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this " edgy " film . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt perhaps more importantly , " 54 " is part of the blossoming subgenre , " the 70s nostalgia film , " which has been picking up mighty steam , what with " boogie nights " and " the last days of disco " coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from " boogie nights , " and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from " the last days of disco , " not to mention several others . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt  " 54 " deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt this is a definite plus . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt but this film doesn't let that happen . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from " i know what you did last summer " ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt he's dim-witted , into being part of " the scene , " and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a 
neg/cv321_14191.txt bit like " saturday night fever , " 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from " clueless " ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt it's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . 
neg/cv321_14191.txt some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn't particularly want to stay . 


neg/cv514_12173.txt

neg/cv514_12173.txt i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt but it sure is a fascinating failure . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt marky . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt  . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt  . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt when they do this , it turns out she is paris' . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt  . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt  . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt goddaughter ! 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it's very bad to have paris against you . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the story is standard action film stuff . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt characters betray each other without a second thought . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt grenades are thrown in tight places . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt people jump out of tall buildings and survive . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt most frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt it's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . 
neg/cv514_12173.txt if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . 


neg/cv231_11028.txt

neg/cv231_11028.txt by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , 
neg/cv231_11028.txt something this bad can't help but look even worse . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt attempts at characterization fall apart . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt there is some promise , but it's all in the setup . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things " exciting . " 
neg/cv231_11028.txt additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt what about that a-list cast ? 
neg/cv231_11028.txt not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt if that's the case , forgiveness is granted . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . 
neg/cv231_11028.txt even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .

neg/cv061_9321.txt okay , here's the deal . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well , i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , " do me a favor , sweetheart .

neg/cv061_9321.txt a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n . c . , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt sleep in . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt eat pancakes at noon .

neg/cv061_9321.txt but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt and , if you do , don't make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt you apparently thought you needed a break from making " important films . " 
neg/cv061_9321.txt cool . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt that's cool , too . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , " what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "

neg/cv061_9321.txt while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? 
neg/cv061_9321.txt probably not .

neg/cv061_9321.txt we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt bobby as terminator ? 
neg/cv061_9321.txt stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters .

neg/cv061_9321.txt it's the oliver stone you've always known .

neg/cv061_9321.txt but pictures of what ? 
neg/cv061_9321.txt i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt that's fine . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) 
neg/cv061_9321.txt do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . 
neg/cv061_9321.txt this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . 


neg/cv230_7913.txt

neg/cv230_7913.txt according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt take for example " casablanca . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt great film , even today . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt another example would be " star wars , " which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good " escape film . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt thus , the curse of the " event film . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt  " independence day " is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt well , this kid is the " event film " in my little analogy . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt and when i rewatched " independence day , " not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of " glen or glenda ? " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt and " independence day " has no balls . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt it plays it safe everywhere . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of " star wars . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i mean , isn't that devil's den ? 
neg/cv230_7913.txt and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in " striptease . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i mean , come on . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt the aliens in " 2001 " were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! 
neg/cv230_7913.txt basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt yep . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i think it's time for impeachment for this guy . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt he's more senile than reagan on pot . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave ) . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with " striptease " in that she has to do it for her son . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt she's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt there are some bright spots . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , " good morning , dave . " 
neg/cv230_7913.txt and they even played r . e . m . 's 
neg/cv230_7913.txt  " it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but there are no real subtle comic moments . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt will gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt as i said , this film has no balls . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that's what it is . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but after a couple months , we all move on to the next " event " film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime . 
neg/cv230_7913.txt this one's short on batteries . 


neg/cv052_29318.txt

neg/cv052_29318.txt this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt no curve balls here , no sliders . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt every pitch is predictable . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt a blind umpire could call this movie . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . 
neg/cv052_29318.txt it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . 


neg/cv445_26683.txt

neg/cv445_26683.txt phaedra cinema , the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as " soft toilet seats , " " trailer : the movie , " and " the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine , " has sneaked its latest release , " the sculptress , " into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " the sculptress " is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( " the lawnmower man " ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced " hamlet " soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " do you have a castle ? " 
neg/cv445_26683.txt sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " jah . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt with ze many turrets " is dobie's perplexing reply . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt the real " star " of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a " genius " frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and " rosemary's baby " -inspired imagery ) . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt bauchau's character criticizes sarah's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she's possessed . . . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt by an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt on the other side of the wall , dobie's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like " actor delivers a stunning macbeth , " actor courted by hollywood studio , " " actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , " and " prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . " 
neg/cv445_26683.txt the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . " 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " yawns ensue . " 
neg/cv445_26683.txt so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt late in the film , their paths finally cross with mind-numbing results . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket , but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah's bathtub overflows . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt no , we don't see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film " the sculptress " is surprisingly lacking . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt the only thing worth looking at is san francisco , and writer/director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary , windswept , and deserted . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt  " the sculptress " isn't even bad enough to be fun . 
neg/cv445_26683.txt luckily , a limited release has made it easy to avoid . 


neg/cv743_17023.txt

neg/cv743_17023.txt in " gia " , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt sadly , though , my fears were realized . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt these early scenes were interesting . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt >from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt it all seemed so excessive . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? 
neg/cv743_17023.txt couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? 
neg/cv743_17023.txt or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt what do they do that warrants a movie ? 
neg/cv743_17023.txt strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? 
neg/cv743_17023.txt i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt gia did not . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . 
neg/cv743_17023.txt not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned .

neg/cv887_5306.txt this talky , terribly-plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex-new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light-plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that's when the trouble begins . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that's curious but never compelling . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt based on the book by james lee burke , heaven's prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt later , dave is reunited with a drug-abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt huh ? 
neg/cv887_5306.txt the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess . 
neg/cv887_5306.txt in its present form , heaven's prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .
