neg/cv670_2666.txt wyatt earp details thirty-five years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900 . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt after seeing the movie speed twice recently , i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatt's life pass before my eyes in real time . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt this movie was boring , slow , boring , and slow . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt the script happily woman-bashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt they cannot have it both ways . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt  " i now pronounce you husband and wife . " 
neg/cv670_2666.txt sure , they said that in the 1800s . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt  " entrepreneur . " 
neg/cv670_2666.txt sure . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that wyatt's third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt  " oh , the script was written by two men ? " 
neg/cv670_2666.txt  " no kidding ! " 
neg/cv670_2666.txt the movie is torture to sit through . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt the scenery is boring . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt can you say poor editing ? 
neg/cv670_2666.txt everyone looks ugly in this movie . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt when you shoot people from under their chins , they look like they have double chins . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt kevin costner has never looked worse . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt he should sue . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt dennis quaid is marvelous . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt if you have to see this movie just for his performance , go into the theatre at the movie's halfway mark . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt doc holliday ( quaid's character ) shows up at about the 90-minute mark . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt gene hackman is very good . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt is he in the credits ? 
neg/cv670_2666.txt i don't remember seeing his name . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatt's second wife . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt annabeth gish is good as wyatt's first wife . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt i though that jamie gertz played wyatt's third wife , but i later heard that her name is joanna going . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt she looks great but her dialogue sucks . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt she also seems way to young for costner . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt costner seems way to old for 90% of this movie . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt yeah , right . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt this is the worst movie that i have seen in years . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt the last action hero was better that this . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt go see maverick if you want to see a western . 
neg/cv670_2666.txt bullets for dennis quaid's performance only .

neg/cv975_11920.txt stars : armand assante ( mike hammer ) , barbara carrera ( dr . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : 
neg/cv975_11920.txt in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel " i , the jury , " hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in " miami vice " with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( " rocky " ) . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt  " i , the jury " is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt although this takes the 1982 version of " i , the jury " closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt  " i , the jury " had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like " it's alive " ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , " q " ( 1981 ) , and " the stuff " ( 1985 ) . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt he was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt it shows in the final product . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , " i , the jury , " takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt but the problems in " i , the jury " run deeper than the technical . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the title itself , " i , the jury , " refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt in this way , he can be seen as " above the law , " but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's " the girl hunters , " is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt the rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in " i , the jury " were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on " dallas " in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . 
neg/cv975_11920.txt maybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it . 


neg/cv300_23302.txt

neg/cv300_23302.txt your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : it's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is , oh , say , at the end of february . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right ! 
neg/cv300_23302.txt and there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie , and there's some action . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt and there's other . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt stuff . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt too . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt then show a caption reading " six days earlier . . . " 
neg/cv300_23302.txt ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt write a line for the one of prisoners like " i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad . " 
neg/cv300_23302.txt then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt aw . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt and just two days before his release , too . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling " shotgun " about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt the villains' big idea ? 
neg/cv300_23302.txt kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some " diversions " and rob the place . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt it's not like the man isn't capable . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt far from it . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he gets no good one-liners , he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt see , it's called reindeer games . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt get it ? 
neg/cv300_23302.txt get it ? 
neg/cv300_23302.txt shut up . ) 
neg/cv300_23302.txt in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he's dirty and potty-mouthed , he's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he's also extremely inept at what he does . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt [on a side note , gary sinise wins this week's " title ! " 
neg/cv300_23302.txt award , as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ] 
neg/cv300_23302.txt how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt this is a bad movie . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt and what's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad . 
neg/cv300_23302.txt if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .

neg/cv869_24782.txt  " easely one of the worst films of the year . . " 
neg/cv869_24782.txt with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the result is somewhat predictable . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt i didn't have high hopes about arnold's " much anticipated " return to the big screen . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
neg/cv869_24782.txt yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the way it works is he smirks and something explodes . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt films like this has one serious weakness -- logic . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt no matter how you twist the " plot " , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the incredible fact is that such directors never learn . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . . i 
neg/cv869_24782.txt can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just 
neg/cv869_24782.txt give me the address . . " 
neg/cv869_24782.txt indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt we've not seen him in a while . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? 
neg/cv869_24782.txt how about satan ? 
neg/cv869_24782.txt in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's " terminator " . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt this is called " an adult turn " if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt make a wild guess ! 
neg/cv869_24782.txt his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt this requires at least some acting skills . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt but the movie doesn't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . 
neg/cv869_24782.txt as for schwarzenegger , he'll be back . 


neg/cv919_18155.txt

neg/cv919_18155.txt in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt the movie is set in 2018 . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . 
neg/cv919_18155.txt lambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion .

neg/cv449_9126.txt i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , " wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . " 
neg/cv449_9126.txt  ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the film began . . . . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt  ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . ) 
neg/cv449_9126.txt they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt  . . . instead of saying " i do " in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says " i'm gay . " 
neg/cv449_9126.txt this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt it reminded me of the " effeminate heterosexual " sketch from saturday night live . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt however , after the wedding , the film drags on . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , " he's gay . " 
neg/cv449_9126.txt it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt  ( much like this review you are saying ) 
neg/cv449_9126.txt overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets . 
neg/cv449_9126.txt see it in economy time . 


neg/cv597_26744.txt

neg/cv597_26744.txt for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt and not a particularly good one at that . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt what went wrong ? 
neg/cv597_26744.txt mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt why ? 
neg/cv597_26744.txt i haven't the foggiest . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt it's possible that these " spies " could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt god forbid . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt newton bats her eyes flirtatiously . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt cruise grins a little too slyly . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial " i'm the man ! " 
neg/cv597_26744.txt charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the " symbolic " pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt it isn't done any differently here . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a " so you thought i was dead . . . " . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt what a hero ! 
neg/cv597_26744.txt you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next " special " effect . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character . 
neg/cv597_26744.txt all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . 


neg/cv844_13890.txt

neg/cv844_13890.txt synopsis : in " sooner than you think " america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt comments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? 
neg/cv844_13890.txt why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! 
neg/cv844_13890.txt they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt this " movie , " marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt  " how can a movie have guest stars ? " 
neg/cv844_13890.txt you may ask . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt blade squad is dumb . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt blade squad is loud . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt blade squad is obnoxious . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt why not ? 
neg/cv844_13890.txt after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( " knight rider " ) , fast helicopters ( " airwolf " ) , and super fast motorcycles ( " street hawk " ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? 
neg/cv844_13890.txt to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt i can remember liking " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt but , i digress . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt oh yeah , dylan's " knockin' on heaven's door " and bowie's " i'm afraid of americans " are used here , in rather poor taste . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt finally , this is commercial television . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt in a " seinfeld " episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt make up a bunch of new bad words for the future . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . 
neg/cv844_13890.txt when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .

neg/cv870_18090.txt

neg/cv870_18090.txt these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film " borrows " its female lead from basic instinct ) . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the rest simply doesn't work . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt others would probably wince at the lameness of humour . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . 
neg/cv870_18090.txt the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . 


neg/cv444_9975.txt

neg/cv444_9975.txt the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . 
neg/cv444_9975.txt spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie .
