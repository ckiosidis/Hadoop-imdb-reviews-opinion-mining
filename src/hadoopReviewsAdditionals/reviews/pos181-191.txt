pos/cv939_10583.txt scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt scream was also known for its self-referential tone . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as " sequels suck " and " the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . " 
pos/cv939_10583.txt scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt  ( whew . ) 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the just add to the fun of watching it . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt i recommend it for other reasons as well . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say " it's just a movie . " 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt they are likeable , but not outstanding . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . 
pos/cv939_10583.txt if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i'll be happy to mark my calendar .

pos/cv498_8832.txt this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham's series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960's . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like " what's america got to do with anything ? 
pos/cv498_8832.txt this is mississippi ! " 
pos/cv498_8832.txt as beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt meanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn't let her husband's death rest until she got the conviction . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt both deserve serious oscar-consideration . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt let's face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey's wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt and baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt either poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg's facial features didn't change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband's dead body 25-years earlier . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt yet woods' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg's father . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt at least the make-up was realistic . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt with some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone's eyes . 
pos/cv498_8832.txt don't get me wrong , the movie wasn't all that bad , but if you've seen grisham's masterpiece , then don't expect this one to be an excellent film .

pos/cv847_1941.txt bruce lee was a bigger-than-life martial artist ( and ) actor . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt bruce's unique character ( i . e . , self-produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt the story is told from his wife linda's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee's life . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt however , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all-white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt in conclusion , the movie was well made , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt and the fighting scenes were all excellent . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt so go see it and enjoy the movie . 
pos/cv847_1941.txt p . s . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven . 


pos/cv557_11449.txt

pos/cv557_11449.txt with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the " film noir " genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt that main character is jeffrey " the dude " lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as " quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . " 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( " has the whole world gone crazy ? ! " he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( " donny , you have no frame of reference here ! " ) . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of " hotel california " and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german " nihilists " who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's " run through the jungle , " and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this " jungle " but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his " this aggression will not stand " speech . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( " the bums will always lose ! " 
pos/cv557_11449.txt shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their " peaceful beach community , " and so on . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least " aggression " of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on " passive , " albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt  " it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , " posits the narrator towards the end . 
pos/cv557_11449.txt i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken .

pos/cv066_10821.txt ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood 
pos/cv066_10821.txt synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham's snobbish adopted daughter , estella . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class " gentleman . " 
pos/cv066_10821.txt pip leaves for london with " great expectations " to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt but life has a way of complicating things . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt until he learns just who his secret benefactor is . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt but soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt this causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships , but finn thinks it's just a case of snobbery . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt when finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt finn leaves florida with " great expectations " to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt what will happen to all of finn's " great expectations ? " 
pos/cv066_10821.txt opinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you've found one here . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt ethan hawke is romantic lead . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt  ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt he romanced uma thurman in gattaca . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . ) 
pos/cv066_10821.txt hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . 
pos/cv066_10821.txt the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .

pos/cv803_8207.txt contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt the thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining . 
pos/cv803_8207.txt for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the universe . " 
pos/cv803_8207.txt and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .

pos/cv461_19600.txt eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt for a while , they are one " big , happy family . "

pos/cv461_19600.txt cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt  " . . . kill them mercifully , but do it . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt you are what you are . . for 
pos/cv461_19600.txt do not doubt , you are a killer ! " 
pos/cv461_19600.txt that is how lestat is teaching luis . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt brad pitt is equally convincing as the " vampire with a human soul " . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt the world is changing around the little child , but she does not . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt ironically the film's only miss is the script . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt anne rice's novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera : 
pos/cv461_19600.txt claudia : " . . . . is that what i should do ? 
pos/cv461_19600.txt let you go . . my 
pos/cv461_19600.txt father , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? " 
pos/cv461_19600.txt luis : " everything will be alright . . " 
pos/cv461_19600.txt claudia : " do you really believe that ? " 
pos/cv461_19600.txt and then they hug emotionally . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt moments like those displayed above and luis' self-pity is a bit tiresome . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt however rice's script is otherwise strong and well structured , bringing up humor and comic episodes , that were more or less hidden in the book . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt when lestat finds claudia's dead dressmaker , whom she has killed , he cries out : " who will make you that dress now ? 
pos/cv461_19600.txt be a little practical . . . . never 
pos/cv461_19600.txt in the house ! " 
pos/cv461_19600.txt moments like that are both entertaining and appealing . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt neil jordan's direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity , homosexuality , love and loneliness . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt his gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently . 
pos/cv461_19600.txt wrapped up in mystery , his new , original picture brings vampire-films to a new height . 


pos/cv967_5788.txt

pos/cv967_5788.txt is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
pos/cv967_5788.txt i was almost stunned by the quality of " who framed roger rabbit ? " , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt  " the little mermaid " harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt however , the endless stream of " the little mermaid " wanna-be's is getting to me . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt from what i've seen of their movies ( " kiki's delivery service " and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed " my neighbor totoro " ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt these movies , particularly " kiki's delivery service , " are wonderfully original and entertaining . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt  " kiki's delivery service " starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt this is where the movie becomes shockingly good . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt this causes kiki to lose faith in herself . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt however , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt  " beauty and the beast " 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for " kiki's delivery service " : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki's flights . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i've ever seen . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt i'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt disney tentatively plans a theater release of " monoko hime " shortly following the summer '97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt i'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt although the wait is unfortunate , it's good to know that it's being released at all , for " kiki's delivery service " is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt watch this movie . 
pos/cv967_5788.txt along with " man bites dog , " and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen . 


pos/cv104_18134.txt

pos/cv104_18134.txt based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt on one hand , it is a fast paced action film . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt on the other , it's a frightening horror film . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn 
pos/cv104_18134.txt the sound down ! 
pos/cv104_18134.txt while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) . 
pos/cv104_18134.txt when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , " end of days " , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .

pos/cv695_21108.txt who would have thought ? 
pos/cv695_21108.txt jim carrey does drama . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , " what a hilarious idea for a movie ! " 
pos/cv695_21108.txt however , it was an even better premise for a drama . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt christof is the " god " of this made-up world . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the film can be described in one word : weird . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt jim carrey actually lived up to the hype . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt and he showed them all up . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he ventures into the wrong elevator . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt a light crashes in front of him . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt his father comes back and is then pulled away . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the " god " of truman's world . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt it really makes you think . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection . 
pos/cv695_21108.txt the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .
