pos/cv194_12079.txt it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? 
pos/cv194_12079.txt and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt a computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt with the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) 
pos/cv194_12079.txt i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt if for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt far from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt what are the lessons we can learn from wargames ? 
pos/cv194_12079.txt 1 . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers . 
pos/cv194_12079.txt 2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers !

pos/cv687_21100.txt big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt o . j . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt luckily , he has a strong supporting cast . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt robert duvall is also an underrated actor . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt duvall is magical in this role . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt this is not the case in a civil action . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt they have comedy coming from all sides . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt the plot is terrific- somewhat . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt the film is smart , witty and thought provoking . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . 
pos/cv687_21100.txt a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

pos/cv475_21692.txt rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt running time : 130 minutes 
pos/cv475_21692.txt being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma' . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt it might just be kevin's best work to date . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt it's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt in 1994 a little $27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt this little film was called 'clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt you really can't meet a person on this green earth who has not seen 'clerks' . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt in 1995 kevin made another movie 'mallrats' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 'chasing amy' came out and was kevin's biggest success to date . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of 'dogma' . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt wow ! what a cast . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt probably the best characters in movies that i like . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt 'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . 
pos/cv475_21692.txt all kevin smith fans must see ! !

pos/cv106_16807.txt as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt we see that he is a mean-tempered person . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he also has tremendous problems with relationships . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt but his bearish persona and stature alienates her . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt finally , he is spiteful and vindictive . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is a prisoner and a slave to it . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? 
pos/cv106_16807.txt we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt very effective . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt coburn displays heft as the bitter dad . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt there's nothing light or fluffy about this film . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt that may turn many moviegoers away . 
pos/cv106_16807.txt but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents . 


pos/cv812_17924.txt

pos/cv812_17924.txt seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
pos/cv812_17924.txt do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
pos/cv812_17924.txt everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt how they will all come together is the process the film deals with . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . 
pos/cv812_17924.txt  ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment .

pos/cv972_26417.txt for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt finally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt of these four , the last one can be a nightmare . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt if you're lucky , things will go smoothly . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt but , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt and with a name like that , how could it not ? 
pos/cv972_26417.txt when greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt when he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , " not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? " 
pos/cv972_26417.txt it's definitely not a good start . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt but greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt it doesn't matter that he's jewish . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt  " oh god . . . you're 
pos/cv972_26417.txt such a good god " , he moons . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the " deniro squint " ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt things get progressively worse for greg . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt and that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt eventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt it's a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt he buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt he tries to find jack's missing cat . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt and there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt the more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt we liked greg . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt and , we liked this movie . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt  " meet the parents " is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt just sit back and watch greg get into trouble . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt no matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt we laugh at greg's expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt deniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . 
pos/cv972_26417.txt their tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell . 


pos/cv579_11605.txt

pos/cv579_11605.txt in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby " the dustbuster " holden ( kathy bates ) . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt the acting throughout primary colors is superb . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt primary colors treads lightly on this issue . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt in fact , most of the " bad guys " are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt primary colors' chief problem is its length . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt it runs about 15 minutes too long . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt there are some scenes which could have easily been cut . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt the scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt the extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . 
pos/cv579_11605.txt it's a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . 


pos/cv331_8273.txt

pos/cv331_8273.txt 'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt see contact with your family . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt it is a movie for all ages . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt --a review by stuart cracraft 
pos/cv331_8273.txt contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 
pos/cv331_8273.txt after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological " geek " side . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the movie's pacing is very good and subtle . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt everything else was very one-sided ( e . g . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt foster ) . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt in fact , zemeckis et . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt al . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . 
pos/cv331_8273.txt perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden . 


pos/cv650_14340.txt

pos/cv650_14340.txt james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt children watch the flames in a burning television . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt even though the " future is not set , " there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt all sara can do is await it . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt  ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) 
pos/cv650_14340.txt the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt for a low budget film , the terminator's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . 
pos/cv650_14340.txt one thing that doesn't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton's hairdo . 


pos/cv846_29497.txt

pos/cv846_29497.txt plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the " great " mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
pos/cv846_29497.txt yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the 
pos/cv846_29497.txt italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but that's not the basis of this movie . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt you know how there are always these " hanger-on " gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
pos/cv846_29497.txt well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that 
pos/cv846_29497.txt is , their boss . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 
pos/cv846_29497.txt  ( " look into my eyes ! " ) 
pos/cv846_29497.txt in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt scary shite . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but there's an ever better scene than that in this film . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he " does " the guy in his underwear ) . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but the flick's not perfect . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( " . . . so 
pos/cv846_29497.txt i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . " -it's 
pos/cv846_29497.txt like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
pos/cv846_29497.txt overdone . ) . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt i also didn't quite " buy " the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 
pos/cv846_29497.txt i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! ! 
pos/cv846_29497.txt i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal ! 
pos/cv846_29497.txt note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . . 
pos/cv846_29497.txt  ; )
