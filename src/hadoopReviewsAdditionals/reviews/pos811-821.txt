pos/cv848_10036.txt clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn't even in , and it's damn good . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt and that's just the mayor . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you'd expect , but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey's parties . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt lots of food , beverages and gunplay . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt yes , an employee of spacey's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt the weird circle of entertainment . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt there's the requisite sexy woman ( alison " nepotist's daughter " eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? 
pos/cv848_10036.txt chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury's foreman . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt it's here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey's homosexuality . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt midnight in the garden of good and evil isn't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt in fact , i'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category . 
pos/cv848_10036.txt serving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! 


pos/cv604_2230.txt

pos/cv604_2230.txt brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : " you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind . " 
pos/cv604_2230.txt pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . 
pos/cv604_2230.txt those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . 


pos/cv956_11609.txt

pos/cv956_11609.txt uncompromising french director robert bresson's " lancelot of the lake " achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's " morte darthur . " 
pos/cv956_11609.txt instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt chivalry has no place in " lancelot of the lake , " except as that of a dying ideal . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt  " lancelot of the lake " is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt all the actors he used in " lancelot of the lake " had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt nevertheless , " lancelot of the lake " is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt bresson's style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . 
pos/cv956_11609.txt by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns " lancelot of the lake " into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . 


pos/cv626_7410.txt

pos/cv626_7410.txt this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the plot is thus . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , " aren't speaking russian " . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story's climax is now given real weight . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt why on earth were they left out of the original ? 
pos/cv626_7410.txt this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt i say " quite " because some flaws do remain . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . 
pos/cv626_7410.txt nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . 


pos/cv940_17705.txt

pos/cv940_17705.txt when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt a show about nothing ? 
pos/cv940_17705.txt sounds like " seinfeld . " 
pos/cv940_17705.txt a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? 
pos/cv940_17705.txt sounds like " the truman show . " 
pos/cv940_17705.txt what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? 
pos/cv940_17705.txt which is why i was pleasantly surprised by " edtv , " which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt in the hands of a less-experienced director , " edtv " could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt  " action shot ! " 
pos/cv940_17705.txt wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt you get the idea . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt who should ed go out with ? 
pos/cv940_17705.txt you can be sure the pollsters have a list . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt matthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt jenna elfman ( from tv's " dharma and greg " ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called " real life " in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt as with most films by albert brooks , " real life " was funny , but absurd . 
pos/cv940_17705.txt the funniest--and scariest--thing about " edtv " is that it is absolutely believable . 


pos/cv094_27889.txt

pos/cv094_27889.txt as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt for those who are put off by the " art " label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt there are no weak performances in this movie . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt zhang ziyi is a budding superstar . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . 
pos/cv094_27889.txt don't miss it . 


pos/cv298_23111.txt

pos/cv298_23111.txt most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like " toy story 2 " does . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 
pos/cv298_23111.txt thankfully , " toy story 2 " is a wonderful exception . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind " toy story " and " a bug's life , " is still at the top of its game . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit " toy story , " and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt off to save him are buzz and members of the old " toy gang , " including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled " woody's roundup . " 
pos/cv298_23111.txt he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt this means woody now faces a difficult choice . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 
pos/cv298_23111.txt as in the original film , " toy story 2 " contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more " human . " 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt  " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the reason " toy story 2 " works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt not this one . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt  " toy story 2 " is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt there are funny asides to films such as " star wars " and " jurassic park , " among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts " a bug's life " and the 1997 short " geri 's game . " 
pos/cv298_23111.txt  ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt  " toy story 2 " never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it's rare to see a film like " toy story 2 " come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . 
pos/cv298_23111.txt it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing " toy story 2 . " it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .

pos/cv765_19037.txt i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt i didn't get a chance to do so , until now . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt many of the studio's old men had retired or died . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the people who had seen the film didn't think so . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , " this is the same film everyone saw ? 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the one that flopped at the box office ? 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the one that critics and filmgoers alike called " a bad movie " ? 
pos/cv765_19037.txt this doesn't seem like all of the above . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt instead , it's a classic in its own right . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the film has a wonderful cast of characters . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt there's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt there's a likeable character here ! 
pos/cv765_19037.txt not that he's the only likeable character in the film . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt there's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt that better chance has finally come . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney's most proudest achievements . 
pos/cv765_19037.txt i can't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ? 


pos/cv288_18791.txt

pos/cv288_18791.txt notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt and it apparently worked . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt  ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) 
pos/cv288_18791.txt only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's " beauty and the beast " -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt the scene ends only as a british writer would end it . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt  ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous " i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her " episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) 
pos/cv288_18791.txt notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number . 
pos/cv288_18791.txt if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . 


pos/cv231_10425.txt

pos/cv231_10425.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( " $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn " ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel " rum punch " ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? 
pos/cv231_10425.txt sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! 
pos/cv231_10425.txt and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) 
pos/cv231_10425.txt of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . 
pos/cv231_10425.txt with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next .
