neg/cv442_15499.txt the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt too late . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the " rules " for sequels like babe 2 . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though " the pig gets wise " made no sense , given the context of that story partition . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the " that'll do , pig . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt that'll do . " 
neg/cv442_15499.txt now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script ) . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt out . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt e . g . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt daily comes in with noticable results . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_ . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired ) . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt season now with the " original " elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( i ) change the venue into " the big city " . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt this has been praised as wildly original . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt how about the muppets ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt sorry . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt no dice . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by " the boss' wife " played by magda szubanski . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt s-t-r-e-t-c-h . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 
neg/cv442_15499.txt have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 
neg/cv442_15499.txt have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 
neg/cv442_15499.txt i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt no . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt _babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt speaking of " pig " , or , " pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! " . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt the word " pig " is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt this is screenwriting ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt but to farmer hoggett ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt his wife ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt an elderly mickey rooney ? 
neg/cv442_15499.txt much too irreverent . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt  ( " quick ! 
neg/cv442_15499.txt splice those singing mice into those scenes ! " ) . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt the film isn't a colossal failure . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt i liked the pink poodle . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt the dog on the cart , who momentarily thinks he's in dog heaven . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says " that'll do , pig . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt that'll do . " 
neg/cv442_15499.txt that's it . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt hope i didn't ruin it for you . 
neg/cv442_15499.txt but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ? 


neg/cv719_5581.txt

neg/cv719_5581.txt well i guess it's that time of the year again . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt in america they call this time " summer " and it happens once every year . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt and maybe it's the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like " consider this a divorce , " " hasta la vista , baby , " and " you're the disease . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt i'm the cure " actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt this is not entirely a bad thing , of course . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt what am i talking about ? 
neg/cv719_5581.txt i'm talking about the summer " blockbusters , " the " action thrillers , " the " this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go " explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt in the rash of " my , what big guns you have , but wait ! 
neg/cv719_5581.txt mine are bigger " movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of " save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats " offerings . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt i'm talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i'm talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of " my explosion is more real-looking than yours " movies , but nothing else . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called " mission : unavoidable " ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he's ever relocated , is " an actual , real life honest person . " 
neg/cv719_5581.txt because she's so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt lee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt it's around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt it's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt it has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim's heart even from great distances . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i'm certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : " i'll be back . " 
neg/cv719_5581.txt like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt review's rating system : * wait for the video . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv719_5581.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
neg/cv719_5581.txt see it twice . 


neg/cv629_16604.txt

neg/cv629_16604.txt ladies and gentlemen , payback is the most expensive episode of " the equalizer " i've ever seen . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt gibson plays porter , a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger , in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter's back , porter miraculously springs back to life . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt he makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt  ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000 haul . ) 
neg/cv629_16604.txt in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory " operation " ) . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt helgeland's film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt payback should have been called playback : it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt  ( mel : " i want my money . " 
neg/cv629_16604.txt anonymous villain : " no . " 
neg/cv629_16604.txt mel shoots gun . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt anonymous villain dies . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt mel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello ) . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt second verse , same as the first . ) 
neg/cv629_16604.txt it's not porter's single-mindedness that robs the film of snap , crackle , and pop ; as a character who has already " died " once , he has nothing to lose and so much to gain . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt the movie lacks danger . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt payback has a gritty , metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt  ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . ) 
neg/cv629_16604.txt to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman's point blank ) . 
neg/cv629_16604.txt the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither . 


neg/cv571_29292.txt

neg/cv571_29292.txt plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt i guess that i was expecting the former going in . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole " show " atmosphere of this movie either . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the " so the butterfly represents his freedom ? " 
neg/cv571_29292.txt side of things . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? 
neg/cv571_29292.txt what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? 
neg/cv571_29292.txt  ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) 
neg/cv571_29292.txt what ever happened to the lawsuit ? 
neg/cv571_29292.txt and more . . . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt i didn't get it . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added " atmosphere " of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single " mainstream " critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the " official " critics , while i , a regular " joblo " in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . 
neg/cv571_29292.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
neg/cv571_29292.txt moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 ) 


neg/cv047_18725.txt

neg/cv047_18725.txt instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt i have a name for it myself : " gross " . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ? 
neg/cv047_18725.txt this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's " psychotics ward " . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt and then there's the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt not good old theo . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . " 
neg/cv047_18725.txt this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt as yoda would say , inspire it does not . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt i love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . 
neg/cv047_18725.txt tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick .

neg/cv415_23674.txt it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt why ? 
neg/cv415_23674.txt the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt you have been warned . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt what happened during the five months prior to this ? 
neg/cv415_23674.txt did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? 
neg/cv415_23674.txt still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? 
neg/cv415_23674.txt c'mon ) . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt maybe even cheated . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . ' 
neg/cv415_23674.txt okay , it did suck . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt after all , they do pretty well . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ? 
neg/cv415_23674.txt looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . 
neg/cv415_23674.txt while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off .

neg/cv554_14678.txt starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung 
neg/cv554_14678.txt taiwan , 24/12/99 . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the millenium approaches . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt this is what passes for meaningful communication . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt and they say romance is dead . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt they are ciphers . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt  ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . ) 
neg/cv554_14678.txt offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt astaire and rogers this is not . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt if so , he succeeds . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't . 
neg/cv554_14678.txt if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it .

neg/cv481_7930.txt staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt well to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt in 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt he's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i'm usually very easy on films . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt there is virtually no fun in this film at all . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i couldn't have cared less . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad . . . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt and this is coming from a regular fan of his work . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt he talks all to often in this movie . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film . 
neg/cv481_7930.txt i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot .

neg/cv252_24974.txt oh yeah . 
neg/cv252_24974.txt the color scheme is nice . 
neg/cv252_24974.txt the real question is how this movie ever got made .

neg/cv752_25330.txt bad movies described as " a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery " are hard to watch . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt shadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek's worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the " underground " scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) .

neg/cv752_25330.txt the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante's inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus . 
neg/cv752_25330.txt other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty .

neg/cv752_25330.txt and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn't anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ?
