pos/cv102_7846.txt  " the fugitive " is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt the final act concludes with another terrific chase . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt we're so relieved when justice is served . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt it's not the plot is that makes " the fugitive " great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . 
pos/cv102_7846.txt if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

pos/cv675_21588.txt

pos/cv675_21588.txt three things i learned from " being john malkovich " : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt  " being john malkovich " is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt just don't forget to have fun . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt  " i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , " he explains in the press notes , " blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . " 
pos/cv675_21588.txt spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in " three kings " ) takes it from there . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt the white-hot director of the beastie boy's " sabotage , " an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt and then there's the cast . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt navigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt then things get a little weird . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt the performances are superb . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt malkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in " dangerous liaisons , " " in the line of fire , " and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure " con air " ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt far from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt as always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig's actions become unconscionable . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt kenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt cameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt  " being john malkovich " stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt regardless , this contemporary " alice in wonderland " is a real treat . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt i enjoyed watching " being john malkovich , " but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me . 
pos/cv675_21588.txt at one point , craig says , " do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? " 
pos/cv675_21588.txt truer words were never spoken . 


pos/cv596_28311.txt

pos/cv596_28311.txt back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie " antz " . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film " the prince of egypt " and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt on a winning streak , they released " the road to el dorado " and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic " chicken run " in the summer . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy ) . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt  " shrek " is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent . . . but he is shrek . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt with his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s " mulan " does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in " aladdin " . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt she is very funny , and her character fits her to a t . of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt there is many hidden jokes in the film , and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt  " shrek " is a definite kid film , but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't get , but the parents will be laughing . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt believe me though , everyone will be laughing the entire way through . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt in the end , " shrek " gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy and be who you are . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt everybody out there is beautiful in their own way , even though it may be inside . 
pos/cv596_28311.txt there's not many words that can praise " shrek " enough , but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now . 


pos/cv075_6500.txt

pos/cv075_6500.txt well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! 
pos/cv075_6500.txt daylight is a great disaster movie . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) 
pos/cv075_6500.txt stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! 
pos/cv075_6500.txt >from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt there is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . 
pos/cv075_6500.txt rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film . 


pos/cv545_12014.txt

pos/cv545_12014.txt  " dangerous beauty " is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt  " love the love , not the man , " as her mother told her . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt  " dangerous beauty , " which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in " braveheart " ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in " dark city " have assured him a solid place in hollywood . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt  " dangerous beauty " is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film " jack the bear . " 
pos/cv545_12014.txt partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( " thirtysomething , " " my so-called life " ) and in the movies ( " legends of the fall " ) . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt  " dangerous beauty " contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller " kalifornia " ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film " body snatchers " ( 1994 ) . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( " brazil , " " the princess bride " ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( " the age of innocence " ) . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the only problem with " dangerous beauty " is that it doesn't stick with you . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . 
pos/cv545_12014.txt herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . 


pos/cv320_9530.txt

pos/cv320_9530.txt with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt and good characters . . . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt most people don't even realize that it is a film . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt gattaca begins in the 21st century . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt natural child birth is considered old-fashioned . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt labeled an " in-valid , " vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt german introduces him to a " valid " who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed " valid " working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the best thing , however , is the plot . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? 
pos/cv320_9530.txt maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? 
pos/cv320_9530.txt niccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and " valid " peers . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt uma thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn't about her . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt still , he does a good job . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn't talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ? 
pos/cv320_9530.txt hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt and hopefully audiences will too . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt i can't even begin to image what film you do like . 
pos/cv320_9530.txt that frightens me beyond anything . 


pos/cv622_8147.txt

pos/cv622_8147.txt did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? 
pos/cv622_8147.txt or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? 
pos/cv622_8147.txt i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key' . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? 
pos/cv622_8147.txt mandibles ? 
pos/cv622_8147.txt tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the mib agents on the case are " k " , played by tommy lee jones . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , " j " , played by will smith . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt and , this isn't an independence day knockoff . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt yet , this movie is very appealing . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! 
pos/cv622_8147.txt the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . 
pos/cv622_8147.txt let the men in black protect and color your world . 


pos/cv678_13419.txt

pos/cv678_13419.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt though not for lack of trying . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? 
pos/cv678_13419.txt in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little " lucky " cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- " i'll make a man out of you " ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt only " reflections " , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . 
pos/cv678_13419.txt briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . 


pos/cv046_10188.txt

pos/cv046_10188.txt at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt on his way up the stairs , he tells her that " families suck " and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he's finally rid of his family ! 
pos/cv046_10188.txt life is a dream come true . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as " santa " is getting in his car . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he learned how to deal with the furnace . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt but it does have its flaws . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt instead of " i'm gonna get that kid " they say " i'm gonna kill that kid . " 
pos/cv046_10188.txt some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . 
pos/cv046_10188.txt don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . 


pos/cv232_14991.txt

pos/cv232_14991.txt  " last night " could have an " aka " tagged on the end of it that says , " it's the end of the world , and we feel fine " . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt  " last night " is about just that . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt the last night of planet earth's existence . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt nor is the event itself . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt another problem is we never see anybody panicking . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt i would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt i just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt no one had the urge to " rage against the dying of the light " . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt despite these small problems , " last night " is one of the best movies of the year . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt as opposed to the moronic " armageddon " , " last night " treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . 
pos/cv232_14991.txt and bruce willis never shows up to save the day .
