pos/cv137_15422.txt as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more 
pos/cv137_15422.txt than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt this movie is a lot of fun . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt  ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt still , this movie is one that will please many viewers . 
pos/cv137_15422.txt with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .

pos/cv523_16615.txt nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 
pos/cv523_16615.txt a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
pos/cv523_16615.txt this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's " dracula " by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt everyone knows the story of dracula . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt or do they ? 
pos/cv523_16615.txt his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt this man is dreadfully lonely . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt the one i still listen to the most is " tantric songs " , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt this is a timely re-release by anchor bay . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . 
pos/cv523_16615.txt don't miss it . 


pos/cv724_13681.txt

pos/cv724_13681.txt after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um , 
pos/cv724_13681.txt realism , and i've never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt scott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt grace's horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace's newly-broken spirit . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt eventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed " horse whisperer " who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt eventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt the horse whisperer is delicately made . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt i dare say lyrical , since to many people's ear , that word is synonymous with boring . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt hardly . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt scott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt robert richardson's photography casts montana as heaven on earth . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt  ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) 
pos/cv724_13681.txt the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse's motivation . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt unfortunately , one of the horse whisperer's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt i liked both of them , but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . 
pos/cv724_13681.txt luckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters' complex relationships together . 


pos/cv183_18612.txt

pos/cv183_18612.txt the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? 
pos/cv183_18612.txt douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , " what is the point of this ? " 
pos/cv183_18612.txt sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough . 
pos/cv183_18612.txt the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the " reality check " based movies for awhile . 


pos/cv893_26269.txt

pos/cv893_26269.txt let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt was it any good ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a " true " cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a " guy " film could potentially bring . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 
pos/cv893_26269.txt into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt  ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt  ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a " double agent " . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt he's lost his voice . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt does that little itty bitty detail matter ? 
pos/cv893_26269.txt maybe not to most , but it sure made my night . 
pos/cv893_26269.txt and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . 


pos/cv917_29715.txt

pos/cv917_29715.txt plot : a dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt it isn't long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma ( long story ) and the next thing you know , the trucker is following them too . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt lotsa nuttiness ensues and then , they pick up their other friend , venna , a girl who the dude has a crush on . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt but what's this . . . ? 
pos/cv917_29715.txt the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers . . . ? 
pos/cv917_29715.txt you bet ! 
pos/cv917_29715.txt buckle up , dorothy . . . this is gonna be one bumpy ride ! 
pos/cv917_29715.txt critique : a good ol' time at the movies ! 
pos/cv917_29715.txt here's a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything " new " to the forefront ( if you've seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you've crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt let's give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven't seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience ) . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt and much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone ! 
pos/cv917_29715.txt paul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! ) 
pos/cv917_29715.txt but here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt sobieski is also good , but she isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt if you've loved this guy as the " goofball " in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( " this is so awesome ! ! " ) , 
pos/cv917_29715.txt only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt and speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? 
pos/cv917_29715.txt the arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt once again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt plot-wise , i too did wonder how the " bad guy " was able to track them so well , but it didn't really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt a great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year . 
pos/cv917_29715.txt  " this is amazing ! ! ! " 
pos/cv917_29715.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv917_29715.txt american psycho ( 10/10 ) - deep blue sea ( 8/10 ) - eye of the beholder ( 4/10 ) - the fast and the furious ( 7/10 ) - final destination ( 8/10 ) - the glass house ( 6/10 ) - no way out ( 8/10 )

pos/cv580_14064.txt this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt all of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp on the violence . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt robocop takes place in detroit in the future . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt things are pretty bleak . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt nancy allen does a decent job . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt but they made one anyway . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt enter . . . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner 
pos/cv580_14064.txt detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt this film is pretty bizaare . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the effects are still decent though . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt if you liked the first one , watch this . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt but be dissapointed . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt so later comes . . . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke 
pos/cv580_14064.txt ocp is now owned by a large japanese company . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt the japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt among other things . . . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt this movie is easier to follow than the last one . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt which means the plot isn't quite as crowded . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt this movie isn't anything special though . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way . 
pos/cv580_14064.txt really not reccomended . 


pos/cv627_11620.txt

pos/cv627_11620.txt i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i imagine that this shows . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt all of this happens fairly early in the film . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i'd give the preview four stars . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt but i'm not here to talk about the preview . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i'm here to talk about denise richards . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and 
pos/cv627_11620.txt flawless body . . . but 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt the other actors are good , too . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful . 
pos/cv627_11620.txt i loved it . 


pos/cv090_0042.txt

pos/cv090_0042.txt warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt in other words , it's a walter hill film ! 
pos/cv090_0042.txt with a john milius script ! 
pos/cv090_0042.txt i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt and we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt as to women . . . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt gosh ! 
pos/cv090_0042.txt just like the old days . . . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt frankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt the cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up . 
pos/cv090_0042.txt finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups . 


pos/cv950_12350.txt

pos/cv950_12350.txt >from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) 
pos/cv950_12350.txt comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it 
pos/cv950_12350.txt really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , 
pos/cv950_12350.txt i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go 
pos/cv950_12350.txt hoser ! ) 
pos/cv950_12350.txt director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . 
pos/cv950_12350.txt kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " .
