pos/cv411_15007.txt countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , " personal " or " artsy " movies . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of " blockbuster " philosophy . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of " new hollywood " generation of young movie authors who made " artsy " and " personal " films in early 1970s . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt both movies were considered " personal " in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt in a sense , star wars is an also very " personal " film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt but unlike many " personal " movies of the era , its " personality " was in line with the wishes of the general audience . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the plot , set " a long time ago , in a galaxy far away " , begins in a time of civil war . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of " new hollywood " , are prone to point the lack of originality . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt we have a " coming-of-age " hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt often comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt that honour should definitely go to the " oscar " -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . 
pos/cv411_15007.txt yet , even if they are immune to the george lucas' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture .

pos/cv363_29332.txt making his directorial debut , actor jon favreau brings along his swingers co-star , vince vaughn , for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt favreau , who also wrote the script , is bobby , vaughn is ricky . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt by day they are construction workers . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt they also are wanna-be contenders , but neither has had much success . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw , leaving bobby's record at 5-5-1 . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt these two l . a . not-so-wise guys also work for max ( peter falk ) , a mid-level mobster , who is patient and understanding with bobby , but who hates ricky's guts . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt max has an easy job for bobby ; fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz ( a smooth and silky sean combs ) . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt bobby , because of his lifelong friendship with ricky , pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt against his better judgment , max agrees . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt of course ricky , a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks , nearly screws up everything . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt while bobby tries to stay calm and professional , ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt favreau with his hound-dog face and slow-burn personality could be a modern-day oliver hardy , only much wiser . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle , he just keeps yakking and yakking , unaware of the havoc he creates . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt yet despite bobby's constant aggravation and agitation with his partner , a bond of affection and loyalty binds them . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt bobby is button-downed , tightly-wound , always waiting for the next shoe -courtesy of ricky - to drop . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt in new york , the two lackeys are like fish out of water , stumbling from one situation to another , trying to keep alive . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt combs is elegant , cool and low-key menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt falk is amusing in his small role , while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobby's lowlife girlfriend . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt more than anything , made is a movie with heart . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt it is loud , obnoxious and very talkative . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut . 
pos/cv363_29332.txt he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience .

pos/cv154_9328.txt journalism students should dream of making connections like these . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix .

pos/cv154_9328.txt what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience .

pos/cv154_9328.txt the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt  ( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) 
pos/cv154_9328.txt with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt  ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) 
pos/cv154_9328.txt different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work . 
pos/cv154_9328.txt this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen .

pos/cv860_13853.txt

pos/cv860_13853.txt the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in " absolutely fabulous " ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that " hobbling " scene was no less disturbing ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's " number one fan " , he soon becomes her prisoner . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt along with the pig , of course ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt he succeeds , but . . . she 
pos/cv860_13853.txt knocks the glass over ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - " d'oh ! ! " 
pos/cv860_13853.txt other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he 
pos/cv860_13853.txt realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut 
pos/cv860_13853.txt to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ? 
pos/cv860_13853.txt ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt boy , do they work ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned " hobbling " ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt nasty . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! 
pos/cv860_13853.txt sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . 
pos/cv860_13853.txt wonderful stuff .

pos/cv325_16629.txt

pos/cv325_16629.txt i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt 'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt only now do i see the error of my ways . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a " holocaust comedy " ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this " beautiful princess " , as he calls her . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a " hogan's heros " and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a " holocaust comedy " . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a " triumph of the human spirit " , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt some have called the story an " affirmation of the beauty of life " , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt however , i am not denying the movie's greatness . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt believe me , it's fantastic . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . 
pos/cv325_16629.txt in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .

pos/cv316_6370.txt of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt the casting is what puts this film over the top . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark .

pos/cv316_6370.txt his cowboy=

pos/cv316_6370.txt in a round about way , if he weren=92t known as a man who i= s willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt as sinise says " you=92re a payer . 
pos/cv316_6370.txt you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again . " 
pos/cv316_6370.txt one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities .

pos/cv236_11565.txt jerry springer has got nothing on " wild things . " 
pos/cv236_11565.txt john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt but even trash tv topicality can't drag " wild things " down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt  " wild things " would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt if there's a major drawback to " wild things , " it's that it's oversexed to a fault . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt what we don't see is far more effective than what we do . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt er , no thanks . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's " rent , " tries to compensate for a superfluous character . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt theresa russell is just plain wooden . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt  " wild things " has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in " starship troopers . " 
pos/cv236_11565.txt matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt but what we're given works well enough . 
pos/cv236_11565.txt  " wild things " is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .

pos/cv144_5007.txt the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script , inspired performances , a great sense of humor , a large and wonderful cast , and the beautiful scenery of vancouver . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt it's a movie of weddings , marriage , family , infidelity , and--oh yes--love . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt like 3 men and a baby , cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975's cousin , cousine . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt the plot is complicated , but it goes something like this . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt larry and tom are cousins , each of whom is not-so-happily-married . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt tom starts an affair with larry's wife , tish , and to get even , larry and tom's wife , maria , pretend to have an affair of their own . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role , and virtually every performance deserves mention . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt ted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on " cheers , " he is also complex and vulnerable , with more between his ears than empty space . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt as maria , isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy , sensuous , and immensely alluring . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt sean young is perfectly cast as larry's picture perfect wife , tish , a superficial and trendy make-up consultant . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt keith coogan , from adventures in babysitting , is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry's rebellious son , mitch . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt and finally , lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch's rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins' best lines and laughs . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt like moonstruck , cousins is a mix of drama and comedy . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other , as friends and as lovers ? 
pos/cv144_5007.txt well , to its credit , cousins is just such a movie . 
pos/cv144_5007.txt let's hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins 


pos/cv262_12649.txt

pos/cv262_12649.txt on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he says to a black congregation " . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . " ) 
pos/cv262_12649.txt well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he is hit hard with questions about his voting record . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt  ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt fans is not part of bulworth's " truth . " 
pos/cv262_12649.txt that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . ) 
pos/cv262_12649.txt the experience is liberating . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? 
pos/cv262_12649.txt bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt chicken wings , appropriately enough . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt  ( you go , warren ! ) 
pos/cv262_12649.txt when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) 
pos/cv262_12649.txt overtakes the politics , which is too bad . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . 
pos/cv262_12649.txt just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies . 


pos/cv373_20404.txt

pos/cv373_20404.txt taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) 
pos/cv373_20404.txt they are who they are and they stay that way . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 
pos/cv373_20404.txt erm , go to go , i guess .
