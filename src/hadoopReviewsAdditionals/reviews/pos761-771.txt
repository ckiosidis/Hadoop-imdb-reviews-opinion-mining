pos/cv219_18626.txt it must be tough to be a mob boss . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt i can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt and who better than billy crystal . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt the supporting cast sparkles . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt the situation is just too cute to resist . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt but hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . 
pos/cv219_18626.txt and near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .

pos/cv552_10016.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his " one special thing " are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a " big bright shining star " . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of " there are shadows in light , baby " to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's " it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! " 
pos/cv552_10016.txt rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes " this is the best work i've ever done " , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane " how much can you bench ? " 
pos/cv552_10016.txt banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's " sister christian " on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing " i'm so stupid " after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track " you got the touch " in a vain attempt at a musical career . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt  ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) 
pos/cv552_10016.txt and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt draw your own conclusions . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . 
pos/cv552_10016.txt striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year .

pos/cv348_18176.txt bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
pos/cv348_18176.txt the matrix 
pos/cv348_18176.txt what's worse than y2k ? 
pos/cv348_18176.txt how about a fully digital future where nothing is real ? 
pos/cv348_18176.txt that's what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix , a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound ) . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role , hold on . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt there's actually a story with depth here . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix , led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss , who looks quite cool in leather , i must say . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight , although he really doesn't look it at first . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt could this amateur be " the one " as fisburne thinks he is ? 
pos/cv348_18176.txt credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build , something that few special effects-laden films seem to do these days . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt there's plenty of effects to go around , of course , but at least there's a backbone to build them on as well . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo , particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy , yet great . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt i wish the villains weren't quite so " generic " ( leftover g-men from looking for a sweet sci-fi actioner with plenty of stop-motion swooping camera angles and , of course , a motherlode of a helicopter explosion . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project . 
pos/cv348_18176.txt bring it on . 


pos/cv937_9811.txt

pos/cv937_9811.txt synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt if she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt review : the title of this movie turned me off at first . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt i mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? 
pos/cv937_9811.txt the other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt the storyline is simple . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt training . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt nonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt sure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt stepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt jordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt although they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt royce ( what is his surname ? 
pos/cv937_9811.txt do we care ? ) 
pos/cv937_9811.txt almost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt in parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt i still liked it though . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt weaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt as we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt this is an individual's fight for self-advancement . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt we don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . 
pos/cv937_9811.txt it's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not .

pos/cv472_29280.txt jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled " kevin smith's greatest hits " for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith's earlier works including , clerks , mall rats . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt chasing amy and dogma . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt so , be advised : bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith's latest outing . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature , most notably miramax , the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob's distributor . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt others deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt this is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax's production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt jay's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt no matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow " the book " - the rules of the road . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt of course jay's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie's weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt really , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt the movie's highlight , though , is near the finale . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt in hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other's careers and film choices . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt and the laughs continue to grow . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt next up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson's creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt finally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt this bit will leave you howling . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt smith's obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt he allows them to play it all tongue-in-cheek . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt their fun comes through the screen to the audience . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob's swan song . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt but smith realizes that times have changed , and he doesn't want his creations to overstay their welcome . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit , saving the best for last . 
pos/cv472_29280.txt goodbye jay and silent bob .

pos/cv382_7897.txt pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the " problem solver " himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt these are just the major characters . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men " behind " ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 
pos/cv382_7897.txt  " hand cannon " , shooting at the two gangsters . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a " monster " by lance . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . 
pos/cv382_7897.txt surely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . 


pos/cv368_10466.txt

pos/cv368_10466.txt titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the " big summer releases " were dead in the water . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt thank god this film got delayed until december . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt it's my christmas present . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said " if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to . " 
pos/cv368_10466.txt truer words are hard to come by . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? 
pos/cv368_10466.txt not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt it's obvious he truly loves titanic . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the " heart of the ocean " , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt for rose , she is sailing to her doom . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't " weigh the film down " , as some critics have said . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt we then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . 
pos/cv368_10466.txt if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . 


pos/cv938_10220.txt

pos/cv938_10220.txt the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , " vanity -- by far my favorite sin " . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( " lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . " , " i have a million names . . . " ) , as john milton -- the devil . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt but the film , is something else , something original . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt it is also entertaining . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . 
pos/cv938_10220.txt its nice to know that things like this are still being made .

pos/cv417_13115.txt disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's 
pos/cv417_13115.txt just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt but there is trouble on the horizon . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by 
pos/cv417_13115.txt secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt wong , singing : donny osmond ) . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in 
pos/cv417_13115.txt typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized " guardian " dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the animation is on par with some of disney's best . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . 
pos/cv417_13115.txt instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .

pos/cv806_8842.txt bruce willis is a type-casted actor . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the " 5 elements " are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt cut to present day , which is our future . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt the year is 2023 , and new york is the city . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats ! 
pos/cv806_8842.txt anyway , the " evil " comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the " 5 elements " to earth , in order to defend themselves against the " evil . " 
pos/cv806_8842.txt in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt what can you do with a hand ? 
pos/cv806_8842.txt hey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction ! 
pos/cv806_8842.txt this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben's floating cab . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt it's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the " yellow pages " and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ? 
pos/cv806_8842.txt the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt but enough of that . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruction . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim " tiny " lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt although besson's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt some other directors ( like anaconda's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film . 
pos/cv806_8842.txt sci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture .
