pos/cv303_27520.txt gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt  " the gift , " directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt  " the gift " may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's " for love of the game " ) lift the picture up several notches . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's " the talented mr . ripley " ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's " boys don't cry , " hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's " the watcher " ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt giovanni ribisi ( 2000's " the boiler room " ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's " wonder boys " ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt finally , kim dickens ( 2000's " hollow man " ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt the other notable aspect of " the gift " is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , " the gift " is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . 
pos/cv303_27520.txt it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . 


pos/cv308_5016.txt

pos/cv308_5016.txt the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise . 
pos/cv308_5016.txt the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot .

pos/cv415_22517.txt in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt according to the program notes , it was mr . disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which , along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators , is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giant-screened imax theaters , making for a unique viewing experience . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely , people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt for me , that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who , unknowingly , help each other realize their dreams . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwin's rhapsody in blue , the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint-saens . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt here , a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo-yo playing antics . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt they will also giggle as donald duck , playing noah's assistant , tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt  ( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) 
pos/cv415_22517.txt a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . 
pos/cv415_22517.txt if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .

pos/cv216_18738.txt bruce barth's mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt ulee's gold feels like another fonda creation- on golden pond : it has a soft , calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath , the cinematography creates a place of gold , yellow , and olive colors , the music is stirring and tranquil . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt both deal with the hardships of family life . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt nu ? ez is probably independent film's greatest asset , along with john sayles , and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating , heavy tension . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt peter fonda's performance borrows from his father henry fonda's in on golden pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father , peter fonda is quiet , emotional , and weary in this exceptional role . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt ulee jackson , the film's protagonist , is struggling . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt pressure is mounting at the wrong time . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt he is a beekeeper and this is his " busy " season . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt he has to deal with his two granddaughters' needs and erupting hormones , he is forced to pick up his daughter-in-law in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her , and he is faced with a challenging task : unsettled business his son , who is now in prison , has left behind . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt he finds his daughter-in-law , helen , with the two men his son robbed a bank with . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt she has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt that is why he got caught- the police found him with the money . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt now the two men are demanding they get the cash , or they will come after ulee's two granddaughters . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt ulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his platoon to survive . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt he refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt he is a bitter , closed-off man whose only passion is his beekeeping , his granddaughters , and his dead wife . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt connie , his next door neighbor , finally gets through to him with friendly favors . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt she is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt ulee's gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is- until the truth is revealed painfully to him : he is cold and unfeeling . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt of course , in the end , ulee softens up , but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness . 
pos/cv216_18738.txt what is admirable about the movie is peter fonda's winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobody's fool but , in the end , ends up in a class of its own . 


pos/cv309_22571.txt

pos/cv309_22571.txt people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but the right stuff film isn't even fiction . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt ten years later , soviets have launched " sputnik " marking the beginning of the space age . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking " artsy " projects . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and " natural " pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , " mercury " astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt another fine contribution of this film is " oscar " -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt some of the " mercury " astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt film also lacks proper closure . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt but this film , sentimental reminder of the times " when future began " , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow " mercury " astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . 
pos/cv309_22571.txt and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .

pos/cv311_16002.txt all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose " the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability " so that they may " purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . " 
pos/cv311_16002.txt i have not seen " breaking the waves , " the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but " the celebration " works exquisitely in this department . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . 
pos/cv311_16002.txt as such , " the celebration " may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .

pos/cv592_22315.txt errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt death . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt this film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt following this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt morris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt leuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt part of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt this was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt while this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . 
pos/cv592_22315.txt aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience .

pos/cv427_10825.txt it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt other plot elements are thrown in for good measure . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt deceiver has the power to grab an audience . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt both play their characters like familiar types . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . 
pos/cv427_10825.txt occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .

pos/cv866_29691.txt king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt consider it a view to a kill made abstract . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , " i don't know , " ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt what we don't see might not be able to hurt us . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt just close your eyes and think of england . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt why ? 
pos/cv866_29691.txt they aren't real . 
pos/cv866_29691.txt the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory .

pos/cv441_13711.txt

pos/cv441_13711.txt call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt and believe me , there's plenty of it . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt there'd be a phony , " let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! " 
pos/cv441_13711.txt attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt the movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt it's not that way for long . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn't available , is the impulsive one . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg's obvious intention . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? 
pos/cv441_13711.txt there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after " ink " was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt and of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available ) . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt that's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt saving private ryan is worth your time , but it's definitely no schindler's list . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt the movie's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , " tell me i've led a good life . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt tell me i'm a good man . " 
pos/cv441_13711.txt spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . 
pos/cv441_13711.txt and even if it's not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there .
