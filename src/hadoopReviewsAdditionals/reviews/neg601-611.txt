neg/cv212_10054.txt capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt instead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt not a good choice . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director's style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt a . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt apparantly , everybody can now fly . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt or at least let robin shou direct . . . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt b . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt c . ) now for the _really_ bad parts . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt this could have been a really cool movie . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt it isn't . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt some of the plot elements are just plain stupid . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt how stupid ? 
neg/cv212_10054.txt take , for instance , how our heroes move around . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh 
neg/cv212_10054.txt boy . . . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt even worse is the treatment of secondary characters . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt blink and you'll miss 'em . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt most characters had more depth in the video games . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt a good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt there's no explanation at all for this . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt and for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt it almost made me weep . 
neg/cv212_10054.txt to sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes . 


neg/cv622_8583.txt

neg/cv622_8583.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt be forewarned . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it would be derisive . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it would be glib . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it would be dismissive . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it would be entirely accurate . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt  ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) 
neg/cv622_8583.txt meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . 
neg/cv622_8583.txt the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . 


neg/cv308_5079.txt

neg/cv308_5079.txt eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
neg/cv308_5079.txt well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt here's what murphy thinks : " i think the audience is expecting a good time . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt they gonna get sexy . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt they gonna get funny . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt they gonna get drama . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt they gonna get all of that . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt i think it's the best movie i've done " ( paramount radio network ) . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense ) . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt and guess who's to blame ? ! 
neg/cv308_5079.txt the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt murphy's awful script is the culprit . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt and he shoots jasmine guy in the head . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt this is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! 
neg/cv308_5079.txt lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt if you're going to make another sting movie , you've got to do something original . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt  ( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt for what ? 
neg/cv308_5079.txt for shooting reese's little toe off ! 
neg/cv308_5079.txt needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt aiello's zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt in fact , hall's ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt of course , i've already mentioned that i didn't care for murphy's character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . 
neg/cv308_5079.txt they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . 


neg/cv867_18362.txt

neg/cv867_18362.txt whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says " look who's talking ! 
neg/cv867_18362.txt what have you done to the indians ? " 
neg/cv867_18362.txt however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt together with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt geronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt so , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt although such elements of john millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt to be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt instead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt to make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt wes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt contrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt while this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt even hill's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt even his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt on the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic . 
neg/cv867_18362.txt all in all , compared with some of the hollywood's examples of political correctness , this film isn't so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better .

neg/cv680_10533.txt 1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt flash-forward a year . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt  ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . ) 
neg/cv680_10533.txt and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . 
neg/cv680_10533.txt the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . 


neg/cv973_10171.txt

neg/cv973_10171.txt in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as " the client " is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt if mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt this is indeed a cold hearted man . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt she joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the characters have no logic . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films .

neg/cv973_10171.txt george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt his best performances are still on " e . r . " .

neg/cv973_10171.txt arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze's imprisonment . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in " sextette " ( 1978 ) . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough .

neg/cv973_10171.txt without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first " batman " ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt mr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video .

neg/cv973_10171.txt with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , 
neg/cv973_10171.txt gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series .

neg/cv973_10171.txt everything is set for maximum exposure .

neg/cv973_10171.txt there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on " the time machine " ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured .

neg/cv973_10171.txt mr . schumacher is a good director . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt one just has to look back on the films " the lost boys " , " cousins " ( an underrated film ) and " the client " to know that .

neg/cv973_10171.txt the film has no style of individuality . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt it is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty . 
neg/cv973_10171.txt it is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise .

neg/cv543_5107.txt apparently , when crap calls , jim carrey answers . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt here he is , mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time , his second go-around in the role of pet detective ace ventura . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt that means more talking ass-cracks , penis jokes and cries of " al-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lrighty then . " 
neg/cv543_5107.txt it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler's list in terms of dramatic merit , or lack of . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt granted , there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre-school humor , but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt it's a painful experience for anyone with a brain . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon ( in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone's cliffhanger , jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect , or lack of ) and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness ( or , in his case , a level of consciousness ) . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 , 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt why africa ? 
neg/cv543_5107.txt so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches ( " look , the rhino's about to give birth ! " ) . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt if that seems like hee-haw humor to you , by all means , see the movie . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt if not , claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt obviously , there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie , like the first ace ventura film ( i use the word " film " only because it was filmed , not because there's any level of artistic merit . ) , a huge success . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt in fact , carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt you may say to me , " but andrew , look at jerry lewis . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt he was born with a negative i . q . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt and look how popular he was thirty years ago . " 
neg/cv543_5107.txt maybe , but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man's testicles . . . 
neg/cv543_5107.txt lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over . 


neg/cv569_26750.txt

neg/cv569_26750.txt as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt certainly hodges is not complaining . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt years pass . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt or are there simply no rules in war ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the murder of 83 " innocent civilians " has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt where is the u . n . ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt this film ( in a way akin to films such as " a few good men " ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt that is precisely why it's not offensive . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it is completely unobjective . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt many stories are started and never finished . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt many questions are asked , but never answered . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt is it about arab mentality ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt america's foreign policies ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt america's role in the world ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt corruption in the higher circles ? 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it goes on and on . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was " the exorcist " which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt even the actors can not save this film from going under . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt the time has come for the verdict . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . 
neg/cv569_26750.txt and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . 


neg/cv417_14653.txt

neg/cv417_14653.txt the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style " chance brushstrokes . " 
neg/cv417_14653.txt starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt he thinks that francis's paintings have " no bloody use , " and the movie presents no counterargument . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's " amorality and innocence . " 
neg/cv417_14653.txt francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt  " boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , " he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt francis appears to be in complete ecstasy . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt  ( " i'm optimistic by nature . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt i'm optimistic about nothing . " 
neg/cv417_14653.txt  " loneliness is my only true companion . " ) 
neg/cv417_14653.txt we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt love is the devil runs 1 : 30 . 
neg/cv417_14653.txt the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers . 


neg/cv000_29416.txt

neg/cv000_29416.txt plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt they get into an accident . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt what's the deal ? 
neg/cv000_29416.txt watch the movie and " sorta " find out . . . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt so what are the problems with the movie ? 
neg/cv000_29416.txt well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? 
neg/cv000_29416.txt not really . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is " into it " even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! 
neg/cv000_29416.txt okay , we get it . . . there 
neg/cv000_29416.txt are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt do we really need to see it over and over again ? 
neg/cv000_29416.txt how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? 
neg/cv000_29416.txt apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess " the suits " decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's 
neg/cv000_29416.txt just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . 
neg/cv000_29416.txt whatever . . . skip
