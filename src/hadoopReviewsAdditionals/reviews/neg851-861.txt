neg/cv080_14899.txt before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt if i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt less wrinkles . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt not too good for a 'thriller . ' 
neg/cv080_14899.txt also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt again , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt however , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the screenplay is o . k , but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . 
neg/cv080_14899.txt the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .

neg/cv623_16988.txt what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the garbage known as " snuff " films ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt nothing , right ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt well . . . nothing . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt so , why make it , hollywood ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the lack of quality filmmaking in " 8mm " ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
neg/cv623_16988.txt like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
neg/cv623_16988.txt between . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt why not walk out ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of " 8mm " . . . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it's not easy to watch . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt a rich old woman discovers a " snuff " film in her late husband's safe . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque " murder " . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt let me backtrack for a moment . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt see , " snuff " films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and " good " acting make all the difference . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the thought of this " industry " makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , " snuff " films . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer " machine " ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt this film doesn't draw you in . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt  " se7en " ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the " batman " franchise , but " a time to kill " was an immensely overrated disappointment . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , " se7en " . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt however , gratuitous is joel's middle name . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he doesn't leave much to the imagination . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) 
neg/cv623_16988.txt craft . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) 
neg/cv623_16988.txt drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt see . . . no 
neg/cv623_16988.txt subtlety . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt who do we root for in this mess ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt is there anybody out there ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it's not all the director's fault , though . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt why did the actors sign up for this ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud ! 
neg/cv623_16988.txt if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he was so solid as a concerned father in " a civil action " . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or 
neg/cv623_16988.txt they're suckers . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt or they just don't care . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like " payback " ( which was a much better movie ) . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt such a technical error indeed stands out . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt there's not much action here . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt after seeing " 8mm " , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt is that a positive ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? 
neg/cv623_16988.txt i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt you said all that in 1995 . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt move on . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt this film serves no purpose . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious " this stuff is bad " approach . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt that's not likely to happen , though , so " 8mm " is indeed a scummy waste of money . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , " to movies . . . to 
neg/cv623_16988.txt good movies " . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt like " snuff " films , " 8mm " should never have been made . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . 
neg/cv623_16988.txt he used it in " batman forever " , in " batman & robin " , in " a time to kill " , in " falling down " , and it's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .

neg/cv772_12971.txt it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . " ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the credits show us the origin of godzilla . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable " discovery " sequence . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . ) 
neg/cv772_12971.txt when he discovers the telltale radar blip . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt people die . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to " singin' in the rain . " 
neg/cv772_12971.txt it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt no dice , bueller . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
neg/cv772_12971.txt broderick is invaluable to the government . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of " newsradio " cast members . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt  " the radiation isn't an anamoly , " he announces , and lightning strikes . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt  " i believe this is a mutated abberation , " he continues , and lightning strikes again . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
neg/cv772_12971.txt poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : " nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt it's dog eat dog . " 
neg/cv772_12971.txt actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt  " i think i've got a bite , " he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt you can guess what happens next . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , " please don't tell me that's another parade . " 
neg/cv772_12971.txt please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt mayor ebert is not pleased . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt played by the principal from " head of the class , " he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt dialogue like , " didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? " 
neg/cv772_12971.txt followed by , " back off , gene , " just doesn't work for me . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt  ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . ) 
neg/cv772_12971.txt that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? 
neg/cv772_12971.txt what have i become ? ) and the climactic " godzilla's nest " sequence in madison square garden . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt the main difference is , independence day was about the experience . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . 
neg/cv772_12971.txt that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie .

neg/cv964_5794.txt ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web sites ? 
neg/cv964_5794.txt that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ? 
neg/cv964_5794.txt that you get your best sex on the net ? 
neg/cv964_5794.txt if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ? 
neg/cv964_5794.txt denise calls up scores with some inspired moments . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt  ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) 
neg/cv964_5794.txt but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie . 
neg/cv964_5794.txt the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters .

neg/cv337_29061.txt depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt but in case you didn't know this , don't bother remembering it . . . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt the words " original sin " never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the " other man , " a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt don't even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it's much worse than a sin . 
neg/cv337_29061.txt this is sacrilege .

neg/cv535_21183.txt plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt there are certain genres that just don't go together . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt the film opens with a sequence that i still don't understand . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt it involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt in any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name " gentleman highwaymen . " 
neg/cv535_21183.txt lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic travails . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going on . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt the weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level . 
neg/cv535_21183.txt i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn't -- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache .

neg/cv924_29397.txt a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like " head over heels , " " boys and girls , " " down to you " and " she's all that . " 
neg/cv924_29397.txt while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt i first saw him in the independent dark comedy " the house of yes , " where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt  " summer catch " certainly won't help his case . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like " bull durham , " but haven't got a clue how to get there . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . 
neg/cv924_29397.txt in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from " buffy the vampire slayer , " hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , " he does have a nice ass .

neg/cv742_8279.txt

neg/cv742_8279.txt when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of " trillions " and make a live-action masters movie . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that " deja vu " is too polite a term to use in describing it . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt  " blatant uninspired ripoff " would appear more appropriate . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? 
neg/cv742_8279.txt yes , there is . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt one incredible good reason . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt his name is frank langella . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt masters of the universe . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt i remember loving it when i was eleven . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt at twenty one it's difficult to see why . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt besides , this year marks the film's 10th anniversary . 
neg/cv742_8279.txt watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

neg/cv974_24303.txt long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt hitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month .

neg/cv974_24303.txt novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt a wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt then the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt this film is terrible . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt the directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt taking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt altogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . 
neg/cv974_24303.txt however , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? 
neg/cv974_24303.txt no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk .
