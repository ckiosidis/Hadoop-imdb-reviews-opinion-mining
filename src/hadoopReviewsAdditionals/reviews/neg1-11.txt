neg/cv863_7912.txt to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt so much for truth in advertising . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt roland emmerich , who's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt they're decipherer ? 
neg/cv863_7912.txt a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 
neg/cv863_7912.txt so there is a hokey ending ! 
neg/cv863_7912.txt duh ! 
neg/cv863_7912.txt he figures it out in about a minute . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt yea . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt why a suicidal colonel ? 
neg/cv863_7912.txt for the ending ! 
neg/cv863_7912.txt you'll get the hang of this . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt so they went to egypt , right ? 
neg/cv863_7912.txt wrong . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt yea . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! " 
neg/cv863_7912.txt - the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limits " or something . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt the script's terrible . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt the special effects are okay , but nothing great . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt the story's so weak that it's almost opaque . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . . or 
neg/cv863_7912.txt this . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all . 
neg/cv863_7912.txt and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . 


neg/cv210_9557.txt

neg/cv210_9557.txt the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the tinkling christmas tree bell in " it's a wonderful life . " 
neg/cv210_9557.txt bogie's speech at the airport in " casablanca . " 
neg/cv210_9557.txt little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in " e . t . " 
neg/cv210_9557.txt and now , " starship troopers " director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt  " starship troopers , " loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt to put it simply , it's a bug bomb . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt in " robocop " and " total recall , " verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and " starship troopers " starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt it's a veritable " alpha centuri 90210 " as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( " doogie houser's " neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the " showgirls " director's camera roams over their buff bodies . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children " doing their part for the war effort " by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt in " showgirls " fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing " dixie " on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt  " it's okay , " she gasps , " i got to have you ! " 
neg/cv210_9557.txt and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt heinlein's pre- " stranger in a strange land " books were aimed at adolescent males , and " starship troopers " has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . 
neg/cv210_9557.txt avoid " starship troopers " at all costs . 


neg/cv282_6833.txt

neg/cv282_6833.txt the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt we've seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt you know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt turbulence starts out with a " convict " ray liotta being accused of a crime . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt you think there is no way he could have done it , he's so open and kind . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt this is already a problem . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt anyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt well , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial " tracks " and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt he also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt  " the plot stops here " 
neg/cv282_6833.txt i didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i've ever seen . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt it was like they stole for every other movie down to a " t " . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . 
neg/cv282_6833.txt don't even bother ! 


neg/cv532_6495.txt

neg/cv532_6495.txt this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ? 
neg/cv532_6495.txt especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt yup , you're talkin' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt  ( they did in mine , heaven help us . ) 
neg/cv532_6495.txt for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt the tone is terrible and the banter is worse . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt forget wit-- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt  ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? ) 
neg/cv532_6495.txt sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men's march . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ? 
neg/cv532_6495.txt even the dialogue gets drowned out . 
neg/cv532_6495.txt what a waste . 


neg/cv748_14044.txt

neg/cv748_14044.txt dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) , murphy returns in this abysmal comedy . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt he plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt however , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt . ) 
neg/cv748_14044.txt however , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and 'comedy' is ready and waiting to happen . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt except comedy never does happen . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt doctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt sadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt and they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt there are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt if i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt sadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt joke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt she bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt there's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt you'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets , however , with their jilted movement . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt i was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt doctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt murphy has done much better movies ( i . e 
neg/cv748_14044.txt trading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures aren't that good . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt the target audience , aged between 7-13 , who are undemanding , will probably like it however , thanks to it's dumbed down humour . 
neg/cv748_14044.txt everyone else , however , should give doctor dolittle a miss . 


neg/cv959_16218.txt

neg/cv959_16218.txt  " virus " is a monster movie without a monster . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt sadly , " virus " does not deliver , on any level . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt at least , i * think * that's what they do . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt yes , borg . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for " spare parts " . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt blah , blah , blah . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , " tetsuo-the iron man " . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt and the plot is right out of " aliens " . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated " deep rising " . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt but " virus " , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt  " virus " is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt besides the lame " monster " , it's chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! 
neg/cv959_16218.txt now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt finally , " virus " isn't scary . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt as it is , it's about as frightening as a box of cookies . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt skip " virus " . 
neg/cv959_16218.txt if it's a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) " aliens " . 


neg/cv687_22207.txt

neg/cv687_22207.txt an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt but john , it just wasn't scary . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt i know it sounds strange , but it actually works . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . 
neg/cv687_22207.txt actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .

neg/cv151_17231.txt in " twilight , " a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m .

neg/cv151_17231.txt as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt newman . sarandon . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt hackman . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , " twilight " would seem very promising . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt however , the script is tired and predictable . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt  " twilight " wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt  " twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody's fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with . 
neg/cv151_17231.txt  " twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

neg/cv203_19052.txt synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he " wipes his ass , " throw tantrums , and scream for his " god damned " treats . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt self centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt that's the essence of big daddy . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . 
neg/cv203_19052.txt to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's " ice cold tits . "
