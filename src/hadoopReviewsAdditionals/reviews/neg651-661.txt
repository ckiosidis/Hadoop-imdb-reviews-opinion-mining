neg/cv096_12262.txt much ado about nothing . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt ah , how sweet the irony ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt he just doesn't " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt what a load of old cobblers . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt get monty python . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt get woody allen . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt get john waters . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt whatever . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt and banish this nonsense to where it belongs . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt but boy , does she owe me one ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt i won't spend too much time on the plot . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt there's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt nothing wrong with most of the cast , either . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt light comedy shouldn't be complex . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt ho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt oh please ! 
neg/cv096_12262.txt there's wit in here somewhere , i'm told . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt i call it pretentious . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt in the end , it's cringeworthy . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . 
neg/cv096_12262.txt comedy ? 
neg/cv096_12262.txt bah , humbug ! 


neg/cv718_12227.txt

neg/cv718_12227.txt there are scenes in " the big hit " that are so awful , they simply defy description . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made " last action hero " ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt presumably , " the big hit " is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt  " lethal weapon 2 " ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt unfortunately , in " the big hit , " it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt unfortunately , there are no laughs . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's " boogie nights . " 
neg/cv718_12227.txt however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see " grosse pointe blank " for the same character , much better developed ) . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt the movie wants us to think , " gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . " 
neg/cv718_12227.txt the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by " jurassic park , " and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of " king kong lives , " which is two weeks overdue . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( " face/off " ) , who also served as executive producer . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt wong , who directed such films as " rock'n'roll cop " back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is " it's all love " ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . 
neg/cv718_12227.txt the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole .

neg/cv474_10682.txt how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? 
neg/cv474_10682.txt isn't there a law or something ? 
neg/cv474_10682.txt this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : " i hate that mouse " . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt oh cringe ! 
neg/cv474_10682.txt this is home alone all over again , and ten times worse . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt one touching scene early on is worth mentioning . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors . 
neg/cv474_10682.txt this kind of rubbish will just not do at all . 


neg/cv037_19798.txt

neg/cv037_19798.txt  " lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . " 
neg/cv037_19798.txt  " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it's directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . " 
neg/cv037_19798.txt paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while " jaws " -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt unlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , " " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt  ( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt like the snake in " anaconda , " the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt  " lake placid " also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don't know much about crocodiles . " 
neg/cv037_19798.txt they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? 
neg/cv037_19798.txt creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . 
neg/cv037_19798.txt platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . 


neg/cv728_17931.txt

neg/cv728_17931.txt back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt the hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt well , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt we know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt in the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt during the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . 
neg/cv728_17931.txt the photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . 


neg/cv832_24713.txt

neg/cv832_24713.txt pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is " sex " , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of " sex " ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to " sex " . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt these are things we all do , sometimes . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt they voice simplistic platitudes like " i like to come " or " sex without love equals violence " . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt huh ? 
neg/cv832_24713.txt and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( " sex without love equals violence " ) . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt or realism . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt he gave them heart . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt this is not the way to get any message across . 
neg/cv832_24713.txt why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ? 
neg/cv832_24713.txt cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .

neg/cv751_17208.txt a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt what is the point of this ? 
neg/cv751_17208.txt i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt this was definitely his worst performance to date . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt  ( for now anyway . ) 
neg/cv751_17208.txt christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt blair is under the command of " angel " , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd " maniac marshall " , played by matthew lillard . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the acting is horrible in wing commander . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the special effects are very unrealistic . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the explosions look very unrealistic as well . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt this is very unrealistic . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt it's not much fun to watch at all . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . 
neg/cv751_17208.txt the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !

neg/cv179_9533.txt the camera zooms in incredibly close . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt all of a sudden , with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse , the doors swing open to reveal what's inside . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt close-up thrill-shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear , which is a pretty good sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt rather , you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in , that you stop caring about who lives , who dies and where the story goes . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt instead , you become more interested in how the characters get killed off . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray - two couples and dear friends to one another . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt during the summer just after high school graduation , they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt suddenly , without warning , their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess , they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt relationships fizzle , future dreams crumble , and attitudes change .

neg/cv179_9533.txt and apparently , neither can someone else . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : " i know what you did last summer . " 
neg/cv179_9533.txt the letter-writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it's now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it's too late . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt there is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don't walk towards them yelling " hello " . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt once you yell " hello " , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt it's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's about to happen . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i'm not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks . 
neg/cv179_9533.txt the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it . 


neg/cv833_11961.txt

neg/cv833_11961.txt i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt and you could just smell the disaster brewing . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called " an alan smithee film " -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt the producer is a " liar " who " slept in the white house ; " the media are " maggots " and " leeches " working for publications like " the new york slimes " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke ) . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags " penile implant " after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven " satire " of excess and ego . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . 
neg/cv833_11961.txt otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .

neg/cv438_8500.txt retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) 
neg/cv438_8500.txt a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson 
neg/cv438_8500.txt i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as " dim-witted " . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? 
neg/cv438_8500.txt and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ? 
neg/cv438_8500.txt anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious " lets explain the plot " type approach . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . 
neg/cv438_8500.txt for completists only .
