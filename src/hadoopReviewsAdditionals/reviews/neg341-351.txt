neg/cv681_9744.txt seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds ) 
neg/cv681_9744.txt paul verhoeven's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a " plot " ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt it stank . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a " plot " that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt it stinks . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here's a brief synopsis anyway . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt this involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs' planet . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt much carnage ensues . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt more carnage ensues . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt after being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a " brain bug " which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans ( look , i didn't write this , ok ? ) . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt yet more carnage ensues . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt get the picture ? 
neg/cv681_9744.txt interspersed throughout all this are brief " ads " from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven's robocop . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt there are many problems with starship troopers . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt the plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt harris ( star of tv's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a " brain bug " later on . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt in addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt the characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it's ok because she got to sleep with rico . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt i had hoped that verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt the dialogue is embarassing and isn't helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt finally , the fake " ads " become a nuisance . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt some people will say all of that's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt so what about those battle scenes ? 
neg/cv681_9744.txt well , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt and people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt but this is my problem . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards' character vomits on-screen ) . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt while robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt when the brain bug sucks out a character's brain near the end of the film , it's merely an analogy for what the film has done to us . 
neg/cv681_9744.txt this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 .

neg/cv150_14279.txt jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt his latest film , " knock off , " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt you can't really blame van damme . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt no one , i suspect , has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt and even his sidekick co-star , " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin' copies " schneider , does what's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt no , the problem with the film is its direction . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt and it goes downhill from there ! 
neg/cv150_14279.txt five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt van damme doesn't land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt director hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed " double team , " films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard to know what's going on , who's on whose side , and what the point of all this is . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt faster than you can yell " fruit stand ! " 
neg/cv150_14279.txt we're watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing " move your beautiful big ass , " the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt every now and again " knock off " will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they're wasted . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt if you're interested in the plot , you're better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : " jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with " nanobombs " hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt maybe . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt with paul sorvino . " 
neg/cv150_14279.txt a more accurate summary would be " jean-claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large , blatant coca-cola product placements . " 
neg/cv150_14279.txt the fact that the film is staged during hong kong's last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn't figure in at all . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt perhaps " knock off " 's most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score . 
neg/cv150_14279.txt some of you might remember the mael brothers as the '80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- " kimono my house " indeed ! 
neg/cv150_14279.txt like the cheap jeans and " pumma " sneakers manufactured in hong kong , van damme's latest is a real phony . 


neg/cv112_12178.txt

neg/cv112_12178.txt the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt the sense of deja vu was overwhelming . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt it's director is the usual action movie style . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . 
neg/cv112_12178.txt bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .

neg/cv026_29229.txt

neg/cv026_29229.txt america loves convenience . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . " 
neg/cv026_29229.txt apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? 
neg/cv026_29229.txt as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt explosions are fun . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . 
neg/cv026_29229.txt in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? " 
neg/cv026_29229.txt for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . 


neg/cv071_12969.txt

neg/cv071_12969.txt there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt how do we know this ? 
neg/cv071_12969.txt because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that " the comet is still headed right for us " and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt television is what's wrong with deep impact . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt  " i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . " 
neg/cv071_12969.txt she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt and i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt yeah , thanks , nasa . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt that's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . 
neg/cv071_12969.txt i'm sure it's comforting to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . 


neg/cv387_12391.txt

neg/cv387_12391.txt breakdown is an moderately entertaining , if underwhelming , thriller . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor , taking the scenic route to california through redneck country . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt however , while in the middle of nowhere , their jeep decides to break down , leaving them stranded . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt a friendly truck driver , warren ( walsh ) , offers to give them a lift to town . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt jeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are far superior character and script wise . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt kurt russell is o . k as jeff , although he can seemingly only pull of one expression , which is angry . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt throughout the whole film , he looks angry ( or just pissed off . ) 
neg/cv387_12391.txt quinlan is o . k again , but again she can only pull off one expression , which is looking dorky . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt throughout the whole film , she looks dorky . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt j . t walsh ( who , sadly , recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty weak , and not really menacing enough . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the supporting cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . k , if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt there are some flaws with the plot also , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the picture moves along very slowly also . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt it almost threatens to drop dead . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the picture does pick up towards the end , but by then it's too late . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt mostow directs the action sequences well enough , however . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the film doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion , either . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt the ending tries to be bleak , but just comes off annoying . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt instead , it just turns out to be merely average . 
neg/cv387_12391.txt a missed opportunity .

neg/cv018_21672.txt the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt if you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt now if you're a regular reader of mine , you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? 
neg/cv018_21672.txt no , it definitely is not . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt melissa joan hart ( from abc's " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? 
neg/cv018_21672.txt will this crazy scheme work ? 
neg/cv018_21672.txt do i care ? 
neg/cv018_21672.txt the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt here there's nothing . . . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt just shut the hell up . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over . " 
neg/cv018_21672.txt in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song , there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . 
neg/cv018_21672.txt sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries " v " and " v : the final battle " ) .

neg/cv461_21124.txt the tagline on random hearts reads " in a perfect world , they never would have met . " 
neg/cv461_21124.txt in a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt the rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt all the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt random hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt there is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt other than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt however , it is also hard to compliment it . 
neg/cv461_21124.txt had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be .

neg/cv861_12809.txt i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt sadly , none of this came to pass . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt and farley's classic humor is widespread , too . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . 
neg/cv861_12809.txt guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? 
neg/cv861_12809.txt stick to " tommy boy " , and we'll all be " friends " .

neg/cv931_18783.txt it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt though the blurb alludes to " a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , " the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt he hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal , which subsequently falls through . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt congo escapes , finds endo's ancestor's sword , and comes back , guns blazing , to free the rest of them , and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt the end . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt it is merely _there_ . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated , subplots that are never explained , and many scenes that make very little sense at all . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt the film is shot through with all the tired old " inscrutable japanese samurai " and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt it is quite slow-paced , with only a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt most of the acting is fair , with the possible exception of congo's girlfriend . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt lance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self , and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt i paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt if you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie . 
neg/cv931_18783.txt skip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan .
