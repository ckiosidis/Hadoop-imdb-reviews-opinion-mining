pos/cv536_27134.txt i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt i was dead wrong about all of those things . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the emperor's new groove is funny . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt damn funny . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt here's the plot ; try to follow along . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her " assistant " kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt then the fun starts . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt the sheer weirdness factor is very high . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue . 
pos/cv536_27134.txt that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it .

pos/cv213_18934.txt in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library , casablanca was my third classic in some weeks . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt the others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes , i am trying to see as many of afi's greatest movies ever made as i can ) . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt but , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt what most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca isn't so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt that annoyed me , as did the ending . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt why didn't the plan turn around ? ! ? 
pos/cv213_18934.txt surprisingly , i enjoyed the film . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt i liked bogart's character and his acting ( not over the top as most actors in his era ) . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt at first i was thinking to myself " why ? " 
pos/cv213_18934.txt then , as i watched the film again , i understood why . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt the movie is very well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt casablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solaris ) , but it is a good film and stylishly shot . 
pos/cv213_18934.txt hey , hollywood , how about this : a remake with harrison ford and anne heche ? 
pos/cv213_18934.txt now that would be a classic .

pos/cv691_5043.txt field of dreams almost defies description . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : " if you build it , he will come . " 
pos/cv691_5043.txt then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt  " if you build it , he will come . " 
pos/cv691_5043.txt and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to " ease his pain . " 
pos/cv691_5043.txt ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago " black sox " scandal . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy . 
pos/cv691_5043.txt in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics . 


pos/cv962_9803.txt

pos/cv962_9803.txt anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt  ( especially hercules ) . . . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt emotion . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt anastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt but anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the plot is actually quite well structured . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt there is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt however , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt even without the voices , they act . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt as with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt the songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay . . . ) . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt i can't reccomend anastasia highly enough . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt it's a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics . 
pos/cv962_9803.txt kids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it's also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney . 


pos/cv228_5806.txt

pos/cv228_5806.txt we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt he is well lit via the external house lights . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt his teacher isn't home . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt david's fall over the dark cliff has begun . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala " pulp fiction " . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his " daddy " in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt but it's us being clapped . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt and it works very well . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play ) 
pos/cv228_5806.txt helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . 
pos/cv228_5806.txt it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home . 


pos/cv084_13566.txt

pos/cv084_13566.txt wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt the setting of the film is a town named blue bay . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt it is here that we meet all of the core characters . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt matt dillon stars as sam lombardo . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt playing kelly van ryan is denise richards . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . 
pos/cv084_13566.txt this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists . 


pos/cv704_15969.txt

pos/cv704_15969.txt with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , 
pos/cv704_15969.txt it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt with this and " crimson tide , " he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt  " enemy of the state " is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt i hate to do this , but last year's film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt not that i want every kafkaesque film to be " the game " ( this year's " the spanish prisoner " succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering " id4 " / " men in black " territory . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of " six degrees of separation " for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that " the game " was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : " days of thunder " ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces " enemy of the state " to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt despite never actually becoming great , it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . 
pos/cv704_15969.txt add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom .

pos/cv400_19220.txt the happy bastard's 30-second review : 
pos/cv400_19220.txt american pie 
pos/cv400_19220.txt the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt that's pretty much it . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt most of the actors get their job done , but it's levy who's a hoot , a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious " visual aids " . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt i couldn't stop laughing during this movie , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references , then american pie is for you . 
pos/cv400_19220.txt if you're one of those " conservative " types , well , i'll bet you're having fun at home while this , south park , and austin powers ii plays in theatres , now aren't you ? 


pos/cv739_11209.txt

pos/cv739_11209.txt you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt such is the case with " the big lebowski , " joel and ethan coen's first venture since their " fargo " nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because " lebowski " is an effort that makes words like " strange " and " unusual " seem like an understatement . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt  " the big lebowski " deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that " fargo " did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , " lebowski " is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , " the big lebowski " is immensely lively . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of " the big lebowski " 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt and some will recognize peter stormare -- " fargo " 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt without a doubt , " the big lebowski " is the best film so far this year . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt sure , we're only three months in and the competition ( " deep rising , " " desperate measures , " " the wedding singer , " etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it's still the gospel truth . 
pos/cv739_11209.txt maybe during next awards season , " lebowski " won't be a far cry from " fargo . " 


pos/cv567_29611.txt

pos/cv567_29611.txt plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt this is a " feel-good " kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a " cute movie " in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of " best " in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt thankfully , this film doesn't bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt on the whole , it's a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could've been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film's end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of " scene " that they're developing over in " le pays du vin " , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt in fact , i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt and this guy directed alien : resurrection ? 
pos/cv567_29611.txt get outta here ! ! 
pos/cv567_29611.txt note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . 
pos/cv567_29611.txt good stuff ! 
pos/cv567_29611.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv567_29611.txt chocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 )
