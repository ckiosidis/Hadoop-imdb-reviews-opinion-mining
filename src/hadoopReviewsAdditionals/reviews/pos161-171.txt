pos/cv929_16908.txt one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , " se7en " is just a few steps away from brilliance . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt this piece of work is 100% intensity . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt  " i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . " 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt this is the guy who directed the ominous " alien 3 " . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt  " se7en " is even more ominous because the threat is real . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife ) . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt however , none of them stands out above the material . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in " paradise lost " --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the " sinners " suffer for it . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt if they didn't , it would be one short movie ! 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt we see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in " pulp fiction " . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt  " se7en " is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt still , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt however , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt this character is so well written that it's hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt no serial killer has ever been so creative . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt  " se7en " is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it's often a little too depressing . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt what it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt fincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt fortunately , we don't find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt it's better to imagine what paths they will follow . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt it's got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren't going to cure themselves . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt  " se7en " raises some tough questions and it's intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . 
pos/cv929_16908.txt useless trivia--co-stars in 1995's " se7en " , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in " 12 monkeys " , spacey in " the usual suspects " ( for which he won ) . 


pos/cv679_28559.txt

pos/cv679_28559.txt plot : a big-time momma's boy can't seem to leave his mother's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt he visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is . . . well , he doesn't have any goals . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt then one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn't as welcome anymore in his own house . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it's 
pos/cv679_28559.txt either time to grow up or bow down ! 
pos/cv679_28559.txt critique : first things first ! 
pos/cv679_28559.txt this movie ain't about the " hood " at all , it's an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt do not avoid this film because you think it's about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn't at all . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt it's about you , it's about me , it's about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well . . . grow 
pos/cv679_28559.txt up ! 
pos/cv679_28559.txt this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt granted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt this isn't a kid's movie . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full " adulthood " and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt i certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i'm not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case ) . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt but that's not even half the story . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt you see , the film is damn funny , too . . . and 
pos/cv679_28559.txt i mean , damn funny ! 
pos/cv679_28559.txt i was crackin' up at almost every other scene , and they weren't " set-up jokes " like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is " drinking koolaid " in the kitchen and his infamously improvised " african squat f * * k " scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) 
pos/cv679_28559.txt and there are the performances , too . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt ving rhames , now here's a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt damn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! 
pos/cv679_28559.txt tyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say . . . hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt from scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt and everyone else , too . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt gibson's girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the " typical " bitchie girlfriend that we've seen in many of these relationship movies . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt but that's the thing that i liked the most about this movie . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt everyone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt and yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz 'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a " companion piece " to that film ) . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt a very solid follow-up to an ever greater original , baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt note : the guy who plays jody's best friend in this movie is omar gooding , cuba gooding jr . 's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) . 
pos/cv679_28559.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv679_28559.txt the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 ) 


pos/cv613_21796.txt

pos/cv613_21796.txt at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? 
pos/cv613_21796.txt not in your dreams ! 
pos/cv613_21796.txt imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt three kings is much smarter than that . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least . 
pos/cv613_21796.txt highly recommended . 


pos/cv443_21118.txt

pos/cv443_21118.txt 'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt i will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt she gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt what they find though isn't great . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you'll have to see the movie to find out . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt her character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt with the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt david e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt the characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt but believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt but i guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt sit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt even though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt there's really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . 
pos/cv443_21118.txt 'lake placid' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too . 


pos/cv973_10066.txt

pos/cv973_10066.txt i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent " talk films " which are finding their way into theaters . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , " i love you , " and john replies with , " i know you think you do . " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt it's the kind that goes something like , " yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt there's always the big but . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt  " a great experiment " , he calls it . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the " great experiment " , beatrice asks , " now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt  " you've named the ice ? " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt asks john . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt  " the freezer was a good invention , " says john , " but it's not supposed to be used for everything . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt it's something most of us find strangely familiar . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , " and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! " 
pos/cv973_10066.txt you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : 
pos/cv973_10066.txt beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron . 
pos/cv973_10066.txt beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .

pos/cv038_9749.txt sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt some people simply call it " trash " . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt whew ! 
pos/cv038_9749.txt anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt he was great ! 
pos/cv038_9749.txt cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt misguided ? 
pos/cv038_9749.txt you bet . 
pos/cv038_9749.txt loveable ? 
pos/cv038_9749.txt you bet .

pos/cv517_19219.txt the happy bastard's 30-second review 
pos/cv517_19219.txt notting hill 
pos/cv517_19219.txt a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt sure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt it's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt in short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike . 
pos/cv517_19219.txt one tee-shirt really says it all about him .

pos/cv426_10421.txt by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt to call him the " master of suspense " is an understatement . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt as mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt  " a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , " anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt  " she's no murderess , " he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt  " she's too fine a woman . " 
pos/cv426_10421.txt his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine's portrait nearby . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs . paradine acquitted because , if mrs . paradine dies , his heart will go with her . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt if she is freed , he will be able to forget her . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr . paradine's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt charles coburn plays anthony's legal partner , sir simon flaquer . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt one , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt as the judge's wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt  ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? 
pos/cv426_10421.txt at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt don't miss it . ) 
pos/cv426_10421.txt in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt as anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the paradine case runs 1 : 53 . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt the picture is in black and white . 
pos/cv426_10421.txt it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested . 


pos/cv439_15970.txt

pos/cv439_15970.txt after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , " celebrity , " range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of " manhattan , " my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( " manhattan " really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc . ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word " help " being spelled with an airplane . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's " deconstructing harry " came awfully close ) . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt what the hell has happened to him ? 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt  " bullets over broadway , " though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt  " mighty aphrodite " is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt  " everyone says i love you " was more of a great idea than a great film . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt even " deconstructing harry " is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt if anything , the reception of " celebrity " by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt  " celebrity " is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt it's like " la dolce vita " without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie " but with a deep personal crisis " ) . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is " polymorphously perverse " ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of " la dolce vita . " 
pos/cv439_15970.txt following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( " i've become the kind of woman i've always hated . . . and 
pos/cv439_15970.txt i'm loving it . " ) 
pos/cv439_15970.txt without doing a thing . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the result is a film of highs and mediums . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but you can't help but pat allen on the back for trying . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt but other places are really great scenes . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the opening . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn't ended . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt a banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they'd never look at him the same way . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt they go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt allen's writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i'd almost recommend the film . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt almost . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it's still a smart and insightful film . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they're really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis' character . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm's length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt besides , it's witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen's : that great woody allen feel . 
pos/cv439_15970.txt it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen's oeuvre , it's merely a blip ( no " annie hall " but it's no " shadows and fog " either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice .
