neg/cv711_12687.txt some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt harsh ? maybe . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt justified ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt hell yes ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : " oooh , look look ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt john woo ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt two guns blazing ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt slooooow motion ! " 
neg/cv711_12687.txt and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt unlike most movies this one does not suffer from " stupid bad guy " syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt  ( term used as loosely as possible ) 
neg/cv711_12687.txt survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt solution ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt boom ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : 
neg/cv711_12687.txt our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! 
neg/cv711_12687.txt while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt for instance : 
neg/cv711_12687.txt our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? 
neg/cv711_12687.txt he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . 
neg/cv711_12687.txt for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several " oh come on ! " 
neg/cv711_12687.txt moments . 


neg/cv091_7899.txt

neg/cv091_7899.txt capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt lice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt what's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . 
neg/cv091_7899.txt it's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it .

neg/cv720_5383.txt the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the " police squad ! " 
neg/cv720_5383.txt television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots ! 
neg/cv720_5383.txt movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , and soggy star cameos . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt yeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ? 
neg/cv720_5383.txt leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt as are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt the butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley . ) 
neg/cv720_5383.txt beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave . 
neg/cv720_5383.txt you won't miss a thing . 


neg/cv022_14227.txt

neg/cv022_14227.txt  " knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays . . . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt where chan comes off as endearing in his " normal guy " character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , " double team " ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt fabulous ! 
neg/cv022_14227.txt seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt for example , look at sam raimi . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt  " army of darkness " , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * " knock off " to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt another problem with the film is that it looks cheap . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt even the stars . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt seconds later , the car drives off at full speed . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt finally , the acting . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt nobody gives a good performance in this film . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing " everyman " . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt in case i haven't yet made it clear enough , " knock off " is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt and it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt it's too inept to be funny . 
neg/cv022_14227.txt there are no redeeming factors in " knock off " and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . 


neg/cv656_25395.txt

neg/cv656_25395.txt it seemed like the perfect concept . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
neg/cv656_25395.txt it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt jim carrey's signed on too ? 
neg/cv656_25395.txt even better . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt it's not for lack of trying . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . " 
neg/cv656_25395.txt  ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . ) 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt  " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt  ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
neg/cv656_25395.txt yeah , me too . ) 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt  " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . " 
neg/cv656_25395.txt it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . 
neg/cv656_25395.txt even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire . 


neg/cv600_25043.txt

neg/cv600_25043.txt silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at " the last stop cafe and motel " due to heavy snowfall . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt one of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer , but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ? 
neg/cv600_25043.txt adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt he doesn't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle , and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always , and jurgen prochnow . . . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt what on earth is he doing in this ? 
neg/cv600_25043.txt best performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt as usual with sterling , they've filled out this dvd with extra features . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound , a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone , interviews with the cast and crew , the original trailer , and the usual cast and crew biographies . 
neg/cv600_25043.txt the film itself might not be the greatest , but sterling's effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money .

neg/cv237_20635.txt it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt oh yes , and then there's that little girl . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . 
neg/cv237_20635.txt and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . 


neg/cv391_11615.txt

neg/cv391_11615.txt yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? 
neg/cv391_11615.txt ok ! 
neg/cv391_11615.txt yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt yes , that bill murray ! 
neg/cv391_11615.txt sound like a good , complete movie ? 
neg/cv391_11615.txt yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt that's how cheezy it comes off . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt and what's up with these people passing as high school students ? 
neg/cv391_11615.txt i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt as corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things . 
neg/cv391_11615.txt perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . 


neg/cv085_15286.txt

neg/cv085_15286.txt it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt but was this contest too good to be true ? 
neg/cv085_15286.txt the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . . . " ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt there isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt here's an appropriate example . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt knock-knock . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt  " housekeeping " , says the diminuitive cleaning lady . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt the door suddenly opens up . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt slash . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt next victim ! 
neg/cv085_15286.txt is there any reason to go and see this movie ? 
neg/cv085_15286.txt not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt i secretly wished for him to get filleted . 
neg/cv085_15286.txt did he get 'hooked' ? 
neg/cv085_15286.txt well , let's just say that if he didn't , i would give this film a grade of " d " . 


neg/cv904_25663.txt

neg/cv904_25663.txt it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because " titan a . e . " is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt i don't know what this film is supposed to be about . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there's no payoff . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt there's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt the galaxy here is a total rip-off of the " star wars " universe the creators don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring . 
neg/cv904_25663.txt despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it's just not an interesting movie .
