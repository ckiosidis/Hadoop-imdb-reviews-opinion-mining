neg/cv228_5644.txt first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt hopeful still ? 
neg/cv228_5644.txt well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , " what do you think of my butterfly ? " . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt butterfly ? , 
neg/cv228_5644.txt i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! 
neg/cv228_5644.txt and then it hit me . . . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt the scene had been snipped ! 
neg/cv228_5644.txt damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! 
neg/cv228_5644.txt we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! 
neg/cv228_5644.txt so . . . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt no naked teri hatcher . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt forget about that . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt okay ? 
neg/cv228_5644.txt now . . . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt he's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt three-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt and lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's " adventures of lois & clark " . . . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt she is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days off . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt it's probably safe to say that her day job beckons . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt and at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv228_5644.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
neg/cv228_5644.txt  * * * * * perfection .

neg/cv156_11119.txt

neg/cv156_11119.txt senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt granted , that one joke is initially amusing . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt when wayans's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt unlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . 
neg/cv156_11119.txt but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television . 


neg/cv081_18241.txt

neg/cv081_18241.txt coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . 
neg/cv081_18241.txt but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . 


neg/cv323_29633.txt

neg/cv323_29633.txt plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt pretty good premise , no ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole " psychiatrist working against the clock " thing , actually had me engaged at first . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt but it's at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt we get the overly smart kid who manages to " pull one " over on the bad guys . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt we get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt and what about the film's main plot point ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day's end to do his part ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt  ( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why ! 
neg/cv323_29633.txt and many , many more . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right ! 
neg/cv323_29633.txt watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool " regular guy " part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt she was completely superfluous . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i 
neg/cv323_29633.txt appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . . . yum , 
neg/cv323_29633.txt yum . . . but 
neg/cv323_29633.txt how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt whatever . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt see it if you like dumb thrillers . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through . 
neg/cv323_29633.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
neg/cv323_29633.txt along came a spider ( 4/10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5/10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) - primal fear ( 7/10 ) -- seven ( 10/10 ) 


neg/cv725_10266.txt

neg/cv725_10266.txt the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt after they ricochet off his face , he says , " not a good start . " 
neg/cv725_10266.txt as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed " condor " , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt it's almost a guarantee . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt anyway . . . . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt there aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt in fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt i suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt if you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt knowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt you've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt also of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt unfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt the plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . 
neg/cv725_10266.txt this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . 


neg/cv933_24953.txt

neg/cv933_24953.txt m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt john woo ( " broken arrow " / " face/off " ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as 
neg/cv933_24953.txt we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel .

neg/cv933_24953.txt hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . 
neg/cv933_24953.txt actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point .

neg/cv933_24953.txt ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass .

neg/cv031_19540.txt some movies i should just skip . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 
neg/cv031_19540.txt turns out i was right , mostly . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany ! 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i want more zany here -- and -- here . " 
neg/cv031_19540.txt  " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i want the audience squirming in their seats . " 
neg/cv031_19540.txt  " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . " 
neg/cv031_19540.txt  " what does this scene do ? 
neg/cv031_19540.txt character depth ? 
neg/cv031_19540.txt but where's the zaniness ? 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i don't see zany here . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt if you can't make it zany , cut it ! " 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt or , maybe all career politicians are like that . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt let me rage here just for a minute . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . 
neg/cv031_19540.txt but if true , why ? 
neg/cv031_19540.txt if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . 


neg/cv325_18330.txt

neg/cv325_18330.txt the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt they have accidentally killed one of their own , the " teen dream " , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the girls' cover is surely blown . . . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt not so fast . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful " new girl " at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? 
neg/cv325_18330.txt or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? 
neg/cv325_18330.txt jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she's in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) 
neg/cv325_18330.txt jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt  " detestable " is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . 
neg/cv325_18330.txt it's certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film's title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience . 


neg/cv761_13769.txt

neg/cv761_13769.txt weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a " pr mission " to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the technical side of the film is peerless , as always . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is " realistic , " it would be better to describe it as " having realistic moments . " 
neg/cv761_13769.txt another aspect of the " hollywoodization " of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt  " who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? " 
neg/cv761_13769.txt asks one infantrymen in the group of eight . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as " who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? " 
neg/cv761_13769.txt or some variant thereof . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the " f " word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an " r " rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . 
neg/cv761_13769.txt  .
