neg/cv303_27366.txt the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . ' 
neg/cv303_27366.txt there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt eliot ( corbin allred ) reader . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . 
neg/cv303_27366.txt this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . 


neg/cv967_5626.txt

neg/cv967_5626.txt the crown jewel of 1970's irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt the story begins on the u . s . s . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt poseidon's big new year's cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt let's see , there's the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to " pray to that part of god within yourself . " 
neg/cv967_5626.txt there's the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt there's the hippie singer ( " there's got to be a morning after . . . " ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt and to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt everyone's in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt the second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt in this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt or is the bottom the top ? 
neg/cv967_5626.txt either way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt it's a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt the one note in borgnine's one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn't a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they'll live to see their grandson's birth . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt winters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her " fatass " in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt  " i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , " she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she's swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) 
neg/cv967_5626.txt ridden thighs . 
neg/cv967_5626.txt it's not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole .

neg/cv361_28738.txt capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt  , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
neg/cv361_28738.txt roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt ben kingsley ? " 
neg/cv361_28738.txt my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the second punch comes from gal's past . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " 
neg/cv361_28738.txt however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt it is not a great plot . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt it is an old plot dressed up to look new . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt we see one side of a person's faces . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . 
neg/cv361_28738.txt i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv561_9484.txt

neg/cv561_9484.txt i looked at the " internet movie database " 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for " best picture ( drama ) . " 
neg/cv561_9484.txt anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the " great " disaster films , and that's not really saying a lot for this film . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt  " earthquake " is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt while this worked in , say , " the towering inferno , " it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including " skyjacked " and that classic , " soylent green " ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his " shaft " thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ? 
neg/cv561_9484.txt guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there's genieveve bujold's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt - the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt as for the actual " earthquake , " it's rather a let-down . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt there's a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt there's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt but none of these are all-too suspenseful . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt and there's no real finale . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt even " volcano " ended nicely , and that movie really sucked . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt not only is it hokey , but you don't care about any character . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt who cares if heston dies ? 
neg/cv561_9484.txt who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? 
neg/cv561_9484.txt who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? " 
neg/cv561_9484.txt who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? 
neg/cv561_9484.txt and who cares about that whole plane spiel ? 
neg/cv561_9484.txt if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? " 
neg/cv561_9484.txt is . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome . " 
neg/cv561_9484.txt but that's another story ( and review ) . 
neg/cv561_9484.txt in short , " earthquake " gives disaster pics a bad name .

neg/cv976_10724.txt nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt however half baked doesn't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt the plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt there's the group's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams ) . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse .

neg/cv976_10724.txt his friends promise to raise money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt that is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii ) . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt for a comedy , the film is pretty humorless . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt not that it doesn't try . . . it's 
neg/cv976_10724.txt just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt the four leads are nearly all playing the same character . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt to help out , the film is packed full of cameos . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt steven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt none of them work , beyond the simple " hey , that's _____ " level . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt not as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt granted , it's pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren't a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt to top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt her role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the " your film promotes the use of drugs " camp . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt the film would have been better off by sticking with the " rebel " tone it so eagerly tries to claim . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt yet , in the end , it doesn't really matter . 
neg/cv976_10724.txt watching the film clean and sober , you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is .

neg/cv014_15600.txt parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines .

neg/cv541_28683.txt the first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt in scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt of course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt but this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo's mission : impossible 2 and charlie's angels . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt it is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they'd coalesce . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt they don't . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt while the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt you can almost hear the reels panting . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt it's a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie . 
neg/cv541_28683.txt the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is .

neg/cv367_24065.txt there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see " mission to mars . " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " armageddon , " " apollo 13 , " " the abyss , " " close encounters of the third kind , " " e . t . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the extra-terrestrial , " " alien , " and " aliens . " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt why ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt because there is not one original idea in " mission to mars . " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt of course , there are other reasons not to like " mission to mars , " the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt  " mission to mars " manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the plot , cribbed greatly from " 2001 , " concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in " 2001 " -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in " 2001 " ) . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt  " mission to mars " is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt that's it . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt everything else fails . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in " 2001 " ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does " mission to mars " come to life . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , " 2001 " ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt why are the characters such idiots ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt all the " conflict " is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : " jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together " -- does anyone really talk like this ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the whole film is like that . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : " look , there's mars " astronaut b : " you sure that's mars ? " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt astronaut a : " yeah , that's mars all right . " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt astronaut c : " hey , are you guys looking at mars ? " 
neg/cv367_24065.txt that exchange isn't actually in " mission to mars , " but i wouldn't be surprised if it were . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt the principal actors sleepwalk their way through " mission to mars , " never managing to do away with an apparent " i'm just here to get a paycheck " attitude . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard " decent guy " performance . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt and sinise hams it up with " wistful " facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in " 2001 " who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy " mission to mars , " but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of " mission to mars " has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of " armageddon " ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt me , i alternated between the two . 
neg/cv367_24065.txt there is only one good thing about the way " mission to mars " finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . 


neg/cv251_23901.txt

neg/cv251_23901.txt let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt yes , i do . . . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret " the hitman " hart out of the title . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 3 . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 5 . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? 
neg/cv251_23901.txt i hate that . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 6 . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 1 . they're the better promotion . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 3 . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt 5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . 
neg/cv251_23901.txt and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .

neg/cv816_15257.txt it seems like i'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the " relentless " department . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it's citizen hook . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking 
neg/cv816_15257.txt up . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals .

neg/cv816_15257.txt unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who's sweet on julie . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt to make a long story short-i can't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn't working properly !

neg/cv816_15257.txt julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me-he gets jennifer love-hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp ! 
neg/cv816_15257.txt lucky bastard . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt i didn't like i know what you did last summer and i can't say i liked this continuation any more or less . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ? 
neg/cv816_15257.txt i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis's random selection of victims . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt  ( i don't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer . ) 
neg/cv816_15257.txt director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely on so many shock notes . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt and let that person run wild with the camera . 
neg/cv816_15257.txt  ( aside : if blandy [sic] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says " baby " to a minimum .
