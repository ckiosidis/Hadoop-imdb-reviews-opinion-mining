neg/cv319_16459.txt a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? 
neg/cv319_16459.txt if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? 
neg/cv319_16459.txt regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . 
neg/cv319_16459.txt this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .

neg/cv114_19501.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
neg/cv114_19501.txt holy man 
neg/cv114_19501.txt more like holy crap . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt it's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt it doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt some may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . 
neg/cv114_19501.txt at least he has something for us to laught at . . . 


neg/cv046_10613.txt

neg/cv046_10613.txt all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt no number of name changes can help this picture . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt from that moment on , it's all downhill . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's " lou grant " ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt there isn't any real acting in this film . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . 
neg/cv046_10613.txt fortunately , there are only two elements left . 


neg/cv689_13701.txt

neg/cv689_13701.txt in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt in the second , he was avenging his daughter . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . 
neg/cv689_13701.txt  ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . 


neg/cv416_12048.txt

neg/cv416_12048.txt despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt meanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt  " this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! " 
neg/cv416_12048.txt exclaims one character in the early going . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's " black cancer " to me . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? 
neg/cv416_12048.txt aliens sans flamethrowers . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt at one point she's called on to play alien " empath " ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt williamson suffers the worst indignity . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt he tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as " i'm gonna get african on someone's ass " and not appear ridiculous ? 
neg/cv416_12048.txt but species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt at least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . 
neg/cv416_12048.txt for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore .

neg/cv889_22670.txt some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt last year it was the thin red line . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt this year's " winner " is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt it's about rubin " hurricane " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
neg/cv889_22670.txt detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the " big-shot " hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) 
neg/cv889_22670.txt when rubin was only ten . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin's autobiography . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra " sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us . " 
neg/cv889_22670.txt hmmm . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt of course , we're already told that he's innocent . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt it's almost cruel . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt it's formula stripped to the bare necessities . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt you have your wrongly accused black man . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt but there's nothing else . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt you'd expect some sort of involving investigation . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt brooding to himself . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt brooding to other inmates . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt brooding to lesra .

neg/cv889_22670.txt it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt i wanted something to happen . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt how is that possible ? 
neg/cv889_22670.txt well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt what a waste of a great performer . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ? 
neg/cv889_22670.txt he's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ? 
neg/cv889_22670.txt to call his character ( along with schreiber's and unger's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt if they're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ? 
neg/cv889_22670.txt look : if you're going to make a formula movie , don't undermine the formula . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous . 
neg/cv889_22670.txt not only is it trite , it's boring .

neg/cv548_18944.txt the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : " shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? " ) . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . 
neg/cv548_18944.txt goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . 


neg/cv621_15984.txt

neg/cv621_15984.txt synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series " party of five . " 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt  " party of five , " i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt so too is jennifer love hewitt . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either ) . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt nothing else here is original or interesting . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt they may as well have huge targets painted on them . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt  . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt  . titillating . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive ! 
neg/cv621_15984.txt people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt boring ! 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass " mystery science theater 3000 " -type viewing . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt what a depressing thought . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . 
neg/cv621_15984.txt i'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience . 


neg/cv069_11613.txt

neg/cv069_11613.txt the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt  " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt overacted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt directed by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt particularly one . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt next thing , she cries rape . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt and the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt the community is astonished . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt reporters flee to the scene . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt like so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , " " wild things " eschews character for plot . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt george clinton's score is a delight to behold . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt but it's the humans . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt the characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt not even the unintentionally funny moments work . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt the people in " wild things " are not so much people as they are caricatures . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt then there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . 
neg/cv069_11613.txt ironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all . 


neg/cv310_14568.txt

neg/cv310_14568.txt i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt seriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt an example : " that [car crash] must've been awful . . . for 
neg/cv310_14568.txt everyone involved . " 
neg/cv310_14568.txt you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt i know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don't mind cardboard cutouts , but please don't let the cutouts be so damn bland . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren't on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt good thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he's only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he's just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo's nest . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt which brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it's unoriginality . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven's and williamson's great success ) . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt urban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn't quite succeed . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt it's best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at " that girl in the noxzeema ad " ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : 
neg/cv310_14568.txt female protagonist : why ? 
neg/cv310_14568.txt villain : why ? 
neg/cv310_14568.txt why ? ! ? 
neg/cv310_14568.txt congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt like i said , this movie could've been great . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script . 
neg/cv310_14568.txt still , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer .
