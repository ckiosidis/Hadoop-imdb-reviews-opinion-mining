neg/cv917_29484.txt michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt in about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic " big game , " where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt all that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt i can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt out of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt instead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt reeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt the drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt and maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt that wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt most of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt there's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt the worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt the adults also don't fare well . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt the character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt every time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt kids are supposed to rally around this guy ? 
neg/cv917_29484.txt diane lane , who co-stars as reeves' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt it's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , " these kids trust you , and they don't trust anyone ! " 
neg/cv917_29484.txt then there's d . b . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt i wanted hardball to be good . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt robbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt i haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that " macho man " randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . 
neg/cv917_29484.txt here's hoping that happens in the immediate future .

neg/cv515_18484.txt when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt however , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt however , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt however , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . 
neg/cv515_18484.txt however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .

neg/cv032_23718.txt hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the following morning po sing is found dead . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt  " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt it is both absurd and assured . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's " china girl " , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and " romeo must die " does look good . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the best things about the film are its fight scenes . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt one needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt also " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's " streetfighter " , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt one problem though about the fight scenes . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt they do have an internal rhythm to them . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt here in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the rhythm is monotonous . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt 'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt watch the restaurant fight from the film " rush hour " and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt now look at the warehouse fight from " rumble in the bronx " . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt here in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt jet li is a grand and personable screen presence . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt it's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . 
neg/cv032_23718.txt until then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like " the replacement killer " and , currently " romeo must die " .

neg/cv732_13092.txt i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt for five years , " the x-files " television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of " star trek " fans . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt nevertheless , i will try . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt  " the black ooze , " and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt a " shadow government " is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt mulder and scully know " the truth is out there , " and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1 . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
neg/cv732_13092.txt yes . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
neg/cv732_13092.txt why bring in " the lone gunmen , " three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
neg/cv732_13092.txt these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for " the lone gunmen " ) . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt still , then they vanish just as quickly . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt 2 . the television show never gives us any answers . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt will the movie actually explain some things ? 
neg/cv732_13092.txt yes . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of " the black ooze , " what it is and what it wants . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the " shadow government . " 
neg/cv732_13092.txt there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the " greys " and the roswell crash of 1947 . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt 3 . is the movie any good ? 
neg/cv732_13092.txt no . the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt however , i rather liked that about the series . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt it is the proverbial " blank screen " which we project our minds on . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt it projects onto us the filmmakers mind . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt he did not . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt when they say that " fans " make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt how true that is when we see the " explicit " x-files - there is nothing there . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the following was printed in the st . john's express , st . john's , newfoundland , canada .

neg/cv732_13092.txt breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt however , i rather liked that about the series . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt it is the proverbial " blank screen " which we project our minds on . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt it projects onto us the filmmakers mind . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt he did not . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill . 
neg/cv732_13092.txt &nbsp ; when they say that " fans " make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there . &nbsp ; 
neg/cv732_13092.txt how true that is when we see the " explicit " x-files - there is nothing there .

neg/cv239_29828.txt susan granger's review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus ) 
neg/cv239_29828.txt whatever david lynch is selling , i'm not buying . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt the same cannot be said for former m . g . m . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt dancer ann miller who's stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . 
neg/cv239_29828.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " mulholland drive " is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out .

neg/cv829_21725.txt i had an epiphany today . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill . " 
neg/cv829_21725.txt it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? 
neg/cv829_21725.txt chances are , there * is * truth in advertising . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow . " 
neg/cv829_21725.txt that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt at least i would have been forgiving . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt hey , tis the season . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt  . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt  . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt riiiiight . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt y'know , that just sends chills down my spine . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt yeah . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt ooooooo . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt hint : blood and guts only work a few times . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt each was more predictable than the last . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? 
neg/cv829_21725.txt sheesh . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt was i grossed out ? 
neg/cv829_21725.txt yes . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt did i get spooked a few times ? 
neg/cv829_21725.txt yes . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt but why ? 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i get really disturbed when there is no why . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt the characters were incredibly flat and cliched . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt not to mention downright annoying . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt and of course , all three gals are babes . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt keep that up , geoff , and you'll qualify for the next batman venture . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt and famke jansen ( sp ? ) 
neg/cv829_21725.txt because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante's peak " three times for him : ) . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt all right , i concede . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt there were a couple of things i enjoyed . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt that perverted little amusement park at the beginning . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i probably won't ride a rollercoaster for a while . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt and the machine they used to drive geoffrey's character mad ( see , i don't even remember their names ) . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt it wouldn't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt thank god they didn't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked . 
neg/cv829_21725.txt god , there is no hope .

neg/cv957_9059.txt recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the " on " button . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt the result ? 
neg/cv957_9059.txt william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and filming the dialogue in voice over . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt however i've seen terrible films that are fun to watch . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  ( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  ) that rule doesn't apply here . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt this is a film that takes itself seriously . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt that is it's major fault . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  ) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn't take sides . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt here it's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  ( just look at the way they film him . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  ) from the begining he's our hero and this doesn't work . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt the result is a mess . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt you can feel him striving to be something he isn't . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt he tries very hard . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt key word : tries . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt  " oh look , he's filming above water action from below . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt pretty . 
neg/cv957_9059.txt what does it represent ? " 
neg/cv957_9059.txt why do people do ugly things ? 
neg/cv957_9059.txt i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face . 


neg/cv051_10751.txt

neg/cv051_10751.txt talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! 
neg/cv051_10751.txt spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt the film itself doesn't really have a plot . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even 
neg/cv051_10751.txt when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt whew . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either 
neg/cv051_10751.txt option will be more enjoyable than the film . 
neg/cv051_10751.txt non-fans should know to stay well away from this one . 


neg/cv480_21195.txt

neg/cv480_21195.txt as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt i am befuddled by fight club . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt but if it is , i sure don ? t see it . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt  ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . ) 
neg/cv480_21195.txt all of them play an important role . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt how so ? 
neg/cv480_21195.txt well , i can kinda just tell . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt i can ? t really put my finger on it . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt is that bad for the world ? 
neg/cv480_21195.txt probably . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt not much room for social commentary there . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt we all know that inter-office politics are just that . . . politics . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt so what was the point of all this ? 
neg/cv480_21195.txt the film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt  ( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt even meatloaf is good . ) 
neg/cv480_21195.txt when you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt not them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt fight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt but it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing . 
neg/cv480_21195.txt sure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films . 


neg/cv002_17424.txt

neg/cv002_17424.txt it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt of course , the ads make it seem like so much more . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? 
neg/cv002_17424.txt after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt and with it comes every single clich ? . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . 
neg/cv002_17424.txt it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late .
