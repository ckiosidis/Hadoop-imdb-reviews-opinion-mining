neg/cv348_19207.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
neg/cv348_19207.txt wild wild west 
neg/cv348_19207.txt a better name for this movie might've been " wild wild waste " . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt heck , ten times . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt but the acting doesn't help either . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion ! 
neg/cv348_19207.txt also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! 
neg/cv348_19207.txt the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt if the performances don't bother you , the story will . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt there's no end to the vicious circle . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt you'll have a better time . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . 
neg/cv348_19207.txt i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

neg/cv360_8927.txt capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt basic instinct's worst crime is that it's not just a bad movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt it's stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt it's supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it's only put into the movie to jerk us around . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt it's also supposed to be sexy , but it's instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt it's a ripoff . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt the biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt or maybe it's the work of a copycat ? 
neg/cv360_8927.txt these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who's on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt joe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer's identity is kept a secret until the movie's final shot . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt this isn't in itself a problem -- the problem is that up until that point , we've been given nothing to work with . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt every clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt red herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt they add up to zip , because they're not happening to people we care about . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt douglas's character is foulmouthed and bitter and that's it ; stone's character has an iron-on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt when we don't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ? 
neg/cv360_8927.txt especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ? 
neg/cv360_8927.txt  ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : " if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! " ) 
neg/cv360_8927.txt one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with . 
neg/cv360_8927.txt i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ? 


neg/cv530_17949.txt

neg/cv530_17949.txt these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt this time , however , third time wasn't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley's boss . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn't work . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can't balance the comedy with " regular " action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . 
neg/cv530_17949.txt in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren't any plans for beverly hills iv .

neg/cv781_5358.txt after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt maybe not ! 
neg/cv781_5358.txt mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt tango & cash has " lowest common denominator " written all over it . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt tango & cash is unbearably noisy . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , " i want to be in this movie . " 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt they simply could have called it " action movie . " 
neg/cv781_5358.txt every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a " road runner " cartoon . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming " lethal weaponesque " adventure . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt like many movie villains , palance likes to play games . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head ! 
neg/cv781_5358.txt the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . 
neg/cv781_5358.txt and , more to the point , tango definitely isn't worth a penny of your cash--so don't bother . 


neg/cv202_11382.txt

neg/cv202_11382.txt jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt hush is one such example . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt the film opens , as many so-called " psychological thrillers " do , by posing as a light drama . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt martha is , of course , the evil one . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt how do we know she's evil ? 
neg/cv202_11382.txt she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt on the other hand , helen is a good girl . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt that's about it for character development . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . 
neg/cv202_11382.txt indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . 


neg/cv888_25678.txt

neg/cv888_25678.txt spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town , where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he's rich and they're not . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result , the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner , and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family's barn . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt jasper's girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however , despite the fact that 1 ) it was her family's diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around , sulk , and smart off to the townspeople . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless , that's apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair ) . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley , especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people ) . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt in the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam's favorite poem as well . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt awwwww . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt soon they're frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper's best friend ) see them together . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the town dance , drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt kelley runs off and decides to leave town . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her , and sam , without even breaking stride basically says " see ya ! " 
neg/cv888_25678.txt and takes off to boston with kelley . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around , its completely worthless . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers , and it's because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt however , not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt i shouldn't have such feelings towards people i like , but their characters are so infuriating that . . . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt well trust me , you'll feel the same way . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt jasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley's provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt but , as in life , nice guys finish last . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film's only sympathetic character gets completely crushed . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt then , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that ) . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt what , things weren't depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ? 
neg/cv888_25678.txt who greenlit this project ? 
neg/cv888_25678.txt who " on earth " thought this would entertain anyone ? 
neg/cv888_25678.txt perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them , and ruins one more for good measure . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment .

neg/cv888_25678.txt the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine . . . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt nothing that will challenge anyone's audio/video systems of course . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film . 
neg/cv888_25678.txt it is merely a waste of time , money and talent .

neg/cv635_0984.txt plot summary : the year is 2024 . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a " terrorist " organisation . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? ) . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt if you have never seen it . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt i wish it had been quicker . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt maybe they could pull it off . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt it's as if they are different people with the same names . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of " who wants to live forever , when love must die " gone to ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 
neg/cv635_0984.txt we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt as for " bad guys , " we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt no more assassins are sent . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt has he no more assassins ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt has he no better ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt so much for plot and characters . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the music is atrocious . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt bring back queen . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) 
neg/cv635_0984.txt when connor played a queen track in a juke box . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered " there can be only one " this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt so why 2/10 ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt visually the film is interesting at all times . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? 
neg/cv635_0984.txt his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i'd * have done it for 12 million . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . 
neg/cv635_0984.txt incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .

neg/cv885_13390.txt director doug ellin's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it , the movie meanders along insulting the viewers' intelligence in almost every frame . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you've heard before . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt  ( " i'm not wearing any underwear , " the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line . ) 
neg/cv885_13390.txt max , chicago's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt max is played without any style by david schwimmer . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why shouldn't the personality-challenged be attracted ? 
neg/cv885_13390.txt the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt neither the script nor the actors make this test believable . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt  " the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ? " 
neg/cv885_13390.txt jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt finally , there is the film's attempt at physical comedy . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt jay's ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt natasha rips jay's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt this is supposed to be funny ? 
neg/cv885_13390.txt most films have some saving grace . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn't . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 . 
neg/cv885_13390.txt it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 


neg/cv908_17779.txt

neg/cv908_17779.txt teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt but she is very much dismayed with her position in life . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt obviously , the field assignment involves a high school . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and " becoming one of them . " 
neg/cv908_17779.txt i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt it is these " qualities " that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt never been kissed is a mediocre film at best . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . 
neg/cv908_17779.txt unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .

neg/cv875_5622.txt everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt billy zane is wooden as the hero . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . 
neg/cv875_5622.txt this is not a good movie .
