pos/cv659_19944.txt bruce willis stars as malcolm , an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife ( olivia williams from rushmore ) are celebrating his award , shoots malcolm in the stomach , then takes his own life . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt almost nine months later , malcolm discovers cole ( haley joel osment , in a brilliant performance ) , another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt he takes on the child's case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one , alienating his wife in the process . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead , and his life becomes forever turned upside down . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt although the first hour is very slow , the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt i was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2 , but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt you'll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt i must give m . night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt a lesser cast could have made this film a joke . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt bruce willis portrays his character perfectly , balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole , showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt toni collette , looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel's wedding , gives a strong performance as cole's mother , who is trying to cope with both her son's " illness " and the passing of her mother . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt finally , olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who's not around and flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt it's a shame that they show cole's abilities in the trailer , because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same , so we already know what's going on before most of the rest of the cast does . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt in retrospect though , the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end of the film , so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt i'm glad that the run of teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare . 
pos/cv659_19944.txt films like this , the similarly themed stir of echoes , and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999 .

pos/cv541_28835.txt capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt  , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv541_28835.txt i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt there is no rock score . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt there are no ballet- like martial arts . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt she has one condition . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt he must stay retired from crime . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt more and more details seem to complicate the job . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old " mission impossible " television series . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of " mission impossible . " 
pos/cv541_28835.txt this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise " mission impossible " films . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today's standards . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt he plays what is nearly a double role . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt one nice ( ? ) 
pos/cv541_28835.txt character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt then the pace really picks up . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt on the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt it adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt it does the job . 
pos/cv541_28835.txt i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

pos/cv836_12968.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt  " all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts " - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 
pos/cv836_12968.txt when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt or so it would seem . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the system formula . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? 
pos/cv836_12968.txt ms . linney is a delight in the film . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt technical credits are first-rate all around . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . 
pos/cv836_12968.txt perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .

pos/cv253_10077.txt  " good will hunting " is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , " prodigy child " film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt unusually directed by gus van sant , " good will hunting " overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt in a nutshell , that's it . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt the core of the " good will hunting " is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by " chasing amy's " ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt but it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( " awakenings " was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt his rich , complex character is the pulp of " good will hunting . " 
pos/cv253_10077.txt everything else pales in comparison . 
pos/cv253_10077.txt  " good will hunting " exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike " little man tate " or " phenomenon " , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned .

pos/cv609_23877.txt a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the review 
pos/cv609_23877.txt if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt mike tyson . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that " in ten years time , i'll be way over this . " 
pos/cv609_23877.txt these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character's struggle . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . 
pos/cv609_23877.txt and we do .

pos/cv250_25616.txt this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . 
pos/cv250_25616.txt it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . 
pos/cv250_25616.txt the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . 
pos/cv250_25616.txt the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .

pos/cv575_21150.txt underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt 1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt he is a man who has had his share of bad things . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt whatever happens the film was excellent to me . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . 
pos/cv575_21150.txt it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .

pos/cv791_16302.txt dad was fighting a fire when they shot him .

pos/cv791_16302.txt at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts .

pos/cv791_16302.txt cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings .

pos/cv791_16302.txt derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt  ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) 
pos/cv791_16302.txt the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief .

pos/cv791_16302.txt it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt  ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . ) 
pos/cv791_16302.txt he also captured the essence of an older brother . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face . 
pos/cv791_16302.txt kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture . 


pos/cv398_15537.txt

pos/cv398_15537.txt shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
pos/cv398_15537.txt if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and 
pos/cv398_15537.txt the game is afoot . . . . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt in some cases , this made for interesting scenes . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of " yes , my lord " and " no , my lord " in the role of reynaldo . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt i think he had two lines . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt you don't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king's english . 
pos/cv398_15537.txt or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes . 


pos/cv510_23360.txt

pos/cv510_23360.txt are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? 
pos/cv510_23360.txt director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film " next stop wonderland " . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? 
pos/cv510_23360.txt does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? 
pos/cv510_23360.txt as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt rather , he is ending it with her . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt to erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a " frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life " . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and " poseurs " . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt there are several subplots involving alan . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt thankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt co-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt it's a sweet , measured moment . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance . 
pos/cv510_23360.txt the film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one's life makes " next stop wonderland " a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects .
