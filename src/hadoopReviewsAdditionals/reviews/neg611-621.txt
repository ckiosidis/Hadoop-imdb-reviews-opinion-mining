neg/cv893_26731.txt i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the movie cuts again , this time to the present . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the " blair witch hunt , " which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt how did i know ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the party of five heads off into the woods as promised . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , " right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! " 
neg/cv893_26731.txt ooh . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt spooky . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt wacky hijinks ensue . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about " reverse , " and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , 
neg/cv893_26731.txt nevermind . ) 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this movie was awful . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt simply awful . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt erica is the nature-loving wiccan . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt steven is the overbearing asshole . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt kim is the antisocial goth girl . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt because she's pregnant ! 
neg/cv893_26731.txt how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt because she wears a lot of eye makeup ! 
neg/cv893_26731.txt how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of " deliverance " ! 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this is weak storytelling at its worst . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt it didn't work . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  ( " honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt let's get on a plane home . " 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  " no . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . " 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  " ok . " ) 
neg/cv893_26731.txt frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the first movie worked by never showing us the horror . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no " monster , " that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt  ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt and if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt the snowfall of manuscript paper ? 
neg/cv893_26731.txt hm ? ) 
neg/cv893_26731.txt blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . 
neg/cv893_26731.txt from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through .

neg/cv993_29565.txt salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . 
neg/cv993_29565.txt unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film . 


neg/cv434_5641.txt

neg/cv434_5641.txt based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt its absence in the film is unforgivable . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as " an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror " . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt a hollow victory indeed . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv434_5641.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
neg/cv434_5641.txt see it twice .

neg/cv374_26455.txt  " my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me " says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt take his advice ! 
neg/cv374_26455.txt to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt and to watch this film is almost as painful . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt  " get carter " is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt jack carter is as tough as tough guys come . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster' . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt explaining his duties , he says , " people make promises and break them . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt i help them remember . " 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he has a chiseled body full of tattoos . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester 
neg/cv374_26455.txt stallone . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt yet , even tough guys know when to put family first . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt the police attribute it to heavy drinking . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out' . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt any one of them may know something about his brother's death . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt all of them have the means of carrying out the deed . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt this all gets tiring fairly quickly . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt stallone has the personality of a slab of stone . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt the weather is constantly overcast or rainy . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt it's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt as a result , " get carter " amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement . 
neg/cv374_26455.txt you're better off leaving this guy alone . 


neg/cv735_20218.txt

neg/cv735_20218.txt this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt now , that's a smart kid . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) 
neg/cv735_20218.txt question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) 
neg/cv735_20218.txt tells him his grandfather is all right . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt maybe that's for another film down the road . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . 
neg/cv735_20218.txt as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose .

neg/cv735_20218.txt this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood .

neg/cv077_23172.txt ahh yes . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the teenage romance . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt along now comes `down to you' . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt well , only happen in the movies . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt no such luck with `down to you' . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . 
neg/cv077_23172.txt and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .

neg/cv574_23191.txt

neg/cv574_23191.txt the characters in jonathan lynn's " the whole nine yards , " yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999's " analyze this " and " mickey blue eyes , " 2000's " gun shy " ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one-dimensional caricatures . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt in a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt unfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh-o-meter available , i'd guess that it briefly ascended around 2 . 5% of the time for me . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt suffice to say , the comedy in " the whole nine yards " works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt nicholas " oz " oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt walking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy " the tulip " tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt once getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt in her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy's whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy's wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt upon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz's dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside " the tulip , " and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill's dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt have you got all that ? 
neg/cv574_23191.txt because there is more . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt much , much more . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt  " the whole nine yards " is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn's 1985 comedy classic , " clue : the movie . " 
neg/cv574_23191.txt going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing " comedy " bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt  " the whole nine yards " is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill's shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv's " friends , " plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997's " fools rush in " to 1999's " three to tango " ) , and it has become a crushing bore . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy " the tulip " tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt their three female counterparts fare noticeably better . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative " species " movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt also popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in " the green mile , " as jimmy's largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt when " the whole nine yards " eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ? 
neg/cv574_23191.txt without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , " the whole nine yards " rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all . 
neg/cv574_23191.txt now , what does that tell you ? 


neg/cv412_25254.txt

neg/cv412_25254.txt it seemed like the perfect concept . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
neg/cv412_25254.txt it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt jim carrey's signed on too ? 
neg/cv412_25254.txt even better . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt it's not for lack of trying . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . " 
neg/cv412_25254.txt  ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . ) 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt  " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt  ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
neg/cv412_25254.txt yeah , me too . ) 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt  " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . " 
neg/cv412_25254.txt it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . 
neg/cv412_25254.txt even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .

neg/cv550_23226.txt disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? 
neg/cv550_23226.txt  ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . 
neg/cv550_23226.txt if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .

neg/cv324_7502.txt i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every " thou shalt not " of the ten commandments into a " thou shalt " ( and vice versa ) . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt his wife's sister rachel ( " friends " ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . 
neg/cv324_7502.txt it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .
