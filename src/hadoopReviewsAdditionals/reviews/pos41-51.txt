pos/cv699_7223.txt very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they live their lives in front of the television . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt even at this point they have no idea what has happened . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they " do his wife " . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to " do her " . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt to them , this is the best day of their lives . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt they even get to meet the president . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . 
pos/cv699_7223.txt one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll 
pos/cv699_7223.txt never hear the end of it ! 


pos/cv578_15094.txt

pos/cv578_15094.txt for a movie about disco-era excess , " 54 " comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt think of it as a sort of " boogie nights " -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , " 54 " leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , " 54 " would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from " i know what you did last summer " ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt but fame doesn't come without a price . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt  " 54 " 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since " 54 " sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt that " 54 " works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( " the wedding singer " 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a " funky little treat . " 
pos/cv578_15094.txt the solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it's a shame their subplot goes nowhere . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in " clueless " ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , " one , two , three , attitude ! " 
pos/cv578_15094.txt sherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big '70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left " er " as rubell's accountant , but she's criminally underused . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt as the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt when he's not playing the life of the party , the ex- " saturday night live " comedian strips away all of rubell's confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it's a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees . 
pos/cv578_15094.txt and while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate " austin powers " -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with " 54 " 's overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball . 


pos/cv964_6021.txt

pos/cv964_6021.txt you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the title is generic . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt it's meaningless . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt and i can't believe it's good business . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? 
pos/cv964_6021.txt yuck . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the movie itself deserves your attention . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt  ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) 
pos/cv964_6021.txt this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt here's the rundown . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt alain does some investigating . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt that's as much as you need to know . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as " acting . " 
pos/cv964_6021.txt of course , " acting " isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt  ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt  ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) 
pos/cv964_6021.txt while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . 
pos/cv964_6021.txt van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . 


pos/cv980_10953.txt

pos/cv980_10953.txt in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt phil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt however , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt groundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt the screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt ramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt and the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt the performances are also excellent . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt bill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt andie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt there is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt chris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt the supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt in fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt overall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt it almost seems perfect . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt however , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt also , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt overall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . 
pos/cv980_10953.txt an excellent comedy .

pos/cv076_24945.txt

pos/cv076_24945.txt logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt occasionally , we get a film that does manage it . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt terry gilliam's " 12 monkeys " was one such film . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action , " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story , and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt is " frequency " filled with plot holes ? 
pos/cv076_24945.txt yes . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt does it matter ? 
pos/cv076_24945.txt not really . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the film opens in october of 1969 . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the premise of " frequency " is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt when " frequency " gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and " frequency " works as long as it keeps moving . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt  ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) 
pos/cv076_24945.txt i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt there are enough surprises and plot twists in " frequency " to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the other major thing to appreciate about " frequency " is the handling of the father-son relationship . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? 
pos/cv076_24945.txt watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt here , we do care , because we like the lead actors . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt i also liked some of the supporting cast members . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt andre braugher , late of the television show " homicide : life on the street , " gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt perhaps the only thing i didn't like about " frequency " is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt i freely acknowledge that " frequency " may best work as a " guy " movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of " field of dreams " can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . 
pos/cv076_24945.txt who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ? 
pos/cv076_24945.txt or see how their children turn out ?

pos/cv121_17302.txt

pos/cv121_17302.txt i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his " last night of freedom . " 
pos/cv121_17302.txt ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt then , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . 
pos/cv121_17302.txt forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . 


pos/cv197_29328.txt

pos/cv197_29328.txt damn those trailers . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt she takes a nap while he goes for a swim . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt did he disappear to start a new life ? 
pos/cv197_29328.txt was he killed by accident ? 
pos/cv197_29328.txt did he commit suicide ? 
pos/cv197_29328.txt marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt she can't quite get over him . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt they've been married for twenty-five years . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . 
pos/cv197_29328.txt ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer . 


pos/cv838_24728.txt

pos/cv838_24728.txt while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious " suicide " of a friend , and a mortician ( tony " candyman " todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death's new plan and thwart it . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the " scream " audience , " final destination " is the best so far . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt we've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes the villain death itself . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt first-time feature director james wong made the most of that premise . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt everyday objects and events vibrate with menace . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver's " rocky mountain high , " which is played several times in the movie before someone dies . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt  ( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . ) 
pos/cv838_24728.txt the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , " idle hands , " gives a frantic and convincing lead performance . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt seann william scott , who's also in theaters right now in " road trip , " plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt tony todd's one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief . 
pos/cv838_24728.txt bottom line : watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting . 


pos/cv755_23616.txt

pos/cv755_23616.txt anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt anna function is to help provide that link . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt it shows a seduction of intelligence . 
pos/cv755_23616.txt ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 


pos/cv460_10842.txt

pos/cv460_10842.txt deep rising is one of " those " movies . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt heh ! 
pos/cv460_10842.txt them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra " oumph " to get people in theaters . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt confused ? 
pos/cv460_10842.txt let me explain : 
pos/cv460_10842.txt despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt luckily , it's a very good b movie . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt we just don't know when or how horrible it will be . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt a funny b movie ? 
pos/cv460_10842.txt well , that's new . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt  ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) 
pos/cv460_10842.txt and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt cool . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt familiar faces . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt so far so good . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt our man treat is the hero , he'll live . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt famke is the babe , 'nuff said . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt  ( ah ! 
pos/cv460_10842.txt comic relief . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let 
pos/cv460_10842.txt him live . ) 
pos/cv460_10842.txt after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt  ( please kill me . ) 
pos/cv460_10842.txt suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went " ewwww " about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt i'm a man , we nottice these things . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but 
pos/cv460_10842.txt bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt the acting is decent , the effects top rate . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt how to best describe it ? 
pos/cv460_10842.txt put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming " don't go there , he's behind you " and you end up with deep rising . 
pos/cv460_10842.txt for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .
