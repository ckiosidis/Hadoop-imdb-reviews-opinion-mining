neg/cv060_11754.txt one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt and he found out again and again and again . " 
neg/cv060_11754.txt of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt but the film talks down to the viewer . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt the results are little different than one would expect . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . 
neg/cv060_11754.txt mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . 


neg/cv152_9052.txt

neg/cv152_9052.txt there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt it's the environmental protection agency . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! 
neg/cv152_9052.txt taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt slow and plodding , this project is a total mess . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt seagal gallantly replies : " i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . " 
neg/cv152_9052.txt i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . 
neg/cv152_9052.txt still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . 


neg/cv802_28381.txt

neg/cv802_28381.txt if you've been following william fichtner's career ( and there's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he's played some rather similar roles over the years . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt or colonel william sharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard-hitting roles . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt which is why his performance in " what's the worst that could happen ? " 
neg/cv802_28381.txt is such a shock , such a delight . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog-loving detective . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt as alex tardio , fichtner's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt it borders on offensive but doesn't really manage it . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt and it borders on clich ? d stereotype but doesn't quite succumb to that definition either . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner isn't perfect--you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal--but he's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt in fact , had it not been for fitchner's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what's the worst that could happen ? " 
neg/cv802_28381.txt is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny ( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible ? ) 
neg/cv802_28381.txt moviegoing experience . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt fichtner's performance doesn't exactly save the film , and it's not like i'm recommending " what's the worst that could happen ? " 
neg/cv802_28381.txt solely on the strength of the actor's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film's rating from no stars to one-and-a-half . 
neg/cv802_28381.txt thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down--way , way , down--to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn't even warrant discussion . 


neg/cv594_11945.txt

neg/cv594_11945.txt the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt peeks of sunshine are few and far between . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt no wonder the characters are all so miserable . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt then charlie re-enters the mix . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? 
neg/cv594_11945.txt who cares ? ? 
neg/cv594_11945.txt no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt they should know the ending as well as we do . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt as portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt burns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt when he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt two films and three short years later , the luster has faded . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt some movie makers have only one good film in them . 
neg/cv594_11945.txt with back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers , burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club .

neg/cv609_25038.txt  " you can't have any of this . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt it's all mine ! " 
neg/cv609_25038.txt --- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt if there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt compelling , but ultimately not . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt one over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of " rednecks " when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? 
neg/cv609_25038.txt and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? 
neg/cv609_25038.txt i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt the box for the film claims " because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt contains nudity and graphic violence " . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt while both is certainly true , there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt it has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . 
neg/cv609_25038.txt i haven't had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set .

neg/cv638_29394.txt so , obviously , not much has changed . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt this is not a problem , provided that the movie boasts the rapid-fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt but american pie 2 is the very definition of " sequelitis . " 
neg/cv638_29394.txt it's coarser , yes , and it pushes the envelope even more , but its heart isn't in it . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt it's easy cash to capitalize off the first film's success , but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt part of the reason why the film doesn't work , i think , is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt here , everything has been cheapened . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ; they have no motivation except for sex , sex , beer and sex .

neg/cv638_29394.txt missing , too , is the sweetness that permeated american pie , the this-could-be-you quality of the main players . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt here , the characters are too aware of themselves as pop-culture icons , and they're even more one-note . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim , oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self-discoveries at arbitrary moments , none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt and then there's the soon-to-be-notorious scene where jim superglues " himself to himself , " which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film's ailments , one that also permeated say it isn't so , director j . b . rodgers' debut . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt there's a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation , and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt it's hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt if there's one redeeming factor to american pie 2 , it's the inimitable eugene levy as jim's dad , who pops in on jim as he's about to score and utters lines like " your mother and i have been known to get frisky . . .

neg/cv638_29394.txt this is an unworthy sequel to a gross-fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt the box-office of this onw should keep the genre going strong , which is disappointing . 
neg/cv638_29394.txt the genre needs a hiatus ; filmmakers are getting lazy .

neg/cv086_19488.txt lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' 
neg/cv086_19488.txt opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) 
neg/cv086_19488.txt they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 
neg/cv086_19488.txt star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) 
neg/cv086_19488.txt anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , 
neg/cv086_19488.txt instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the actors don't help the movie much either . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt he's not even very 'cute . ' 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the cgi takes away much of the human element , however . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt episode 1 is just disappointing . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt it's got high production values , but little else . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the music is meandering , except near the end . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the effects are nice , but dull . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . 
neg/cv086_19488.txt disappointing is barely the word .

neg/cv234_22123.txt five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional " evil " characters . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be " misunderstood " , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? 
neg/cv234_22123.txt or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? 
neg/cv234_22123.txt well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt in fact , the story is empty within itself . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt wow . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt how interesting . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt whip out those thinking caps , kids ! 
neg/cv234_22123.txt hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter " evil " guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt what a crock ! 
neg/cv234_22123.txt i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt in fact , it was one big bore . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt all in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . 
neg/cv234_22123.txt give that man an award or something !

neg/cv510_24758.txt well lets see . . . i'm 
neg/cv510_24758.txt not quite sure how to review this film , based on its laughter factor . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt well yeah i can , it's not funny . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star , but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over , ( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever ! ) . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt in fact , this could be the un-funniest movie i've seen in a long time , if not the un-funniest . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt let me be the first to say " ready to rumble " is a huge disappointment . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt long time wrestling lovers ( david and scott ) dream of making it to the wcw , and watching jimmy king wrestle . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt that is their hero of course , whom is kicked out of the wcw . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt well here is where the plot thickens ( lol ) : the two wish to rescue the king , and put him back into the wcw but not that easily , because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them , while david's father wants him to become a police officer , and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt what a plot eh ? 
neg/cv510_24758.txt  " ready to rumble " is one of those films that tries to be funny , but sadly fails miserably , everything in the film is imcomprehinsable , and even the trailer wasn't funny . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt the actors are dull , the script awful , and the plot which there isn't much of . . . . really 
neg/cv510_24758.txt annoying . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt i'm not quite sure how great actors like these , and very funny actors too , are given such a lame script , and directed in such a childish manner , that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt this review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't much going for the film , if anything at all . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt only one big laugh is in the film , which isn't all that hilarious . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt i sat in my chair wondering with this 107 ( ! ! ! ! ! ) 
neg/cv510_24758.txt minute " comedy " was going to be over , and sadly it went on forever . 
neg/cv510_24758.txt i'm not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste , but believe me you , it is .

neg/cv985_5964.txt

neg/cv985_5964.txt boy , what a great movie ! ! 
neg/cv985_5964.txt keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt how could this not be a blockbuster ? 
neg/cv985_5964.txt all die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt ol " much ado about nothing " plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt a potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt surely nobody could have any problems with that ? 
neg/cv985_5964.txt morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt this movie is just dying for a comparison with " the fugitive " . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt harrison ford was " the man against the world . " 
neg/cv985_5964.txt he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt we don't get this . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt we get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt the producers here probably thought , " hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ? 
neg/cv985_5964.txt let's rope in that morgan to help us out . " 
neg/cv985_5964.txt well , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt it's not really his fault . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt once again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv985_5964.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
neg/cv985_5964.txt see it twice .
