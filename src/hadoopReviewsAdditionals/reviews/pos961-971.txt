pos/cv184_2673.txt i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt it is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt one of the bad guys was a surprise . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt the pace is fast enough , there are some " action " scenes . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! 
pos/cv184_2673.txt her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt she could use some highlights . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt i like the one story focus . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt basically this movie is reasonably fun . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt there is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously . 
pos/cv184_2673.txt i do give successful comedy high marks .

pos/cv832_23275.txt pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt don't be fooled . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt it starts off with blistering intensity . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt or does it ? 
pos/cv832_23275.txt pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock " escape the boogieman " conflicts the genre typically serves up . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt imam is forced to reassess his faith . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt the dialogue isn't the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt yes , the appearance of riddick's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell . 
pos/cv832_23275.txt twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .

pos/cv987_6965.txt trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors , steve buscemi . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt he gave memorable performences in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dogs . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt now he tries his hand at writing , directing and acting all in the same flick . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy ( buscemi ) hanging around a local bar the " trees lounge " and him pestering his brother . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt it's obvious he a loser . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt but as he says " it's better i'm a loser and know i am , then being a loser and not thinking i am . " 
pos/cv987_6965.txt well put . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt the story starts to take off when his uncle dies , and tommy , not having a job , decides to drive an ice cream truck . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt well , the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie ( chloe sevigny ) and . . . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt after you've seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs , you know he is capable of a better performence . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt i think his brother , michael , did an excellent job for his debut performence . 
pos/cv987_6965.txt mr . buscemi is off to a good career as a director !

pos/cv614_10626.txt mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in town , and he's the nameless animal attraction of " mouse hunt , " dreamworks skg's clever first foray into family fare . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt although it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt but consider that list includes dismal tripe like " air bud , " " flubber " and " that darn cat , " and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull off . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt still , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i'll be hoping that the mouse from " mouse hunt " knocks some sense back into mickey . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from " the birdcage " ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in " the fifth element " ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt but there's a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of " the nightmare before christmas , " and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from " edward scissorhands . " 
pos/cv614_10626.txt  " mouse hunt " is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it's hardly ever mean-spirited . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt it's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt vicki lewis ( beth from " newsradio " ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a " calcium deficiency . " 
pos/cv614_10626.txt blech . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don't think i'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . 
pos/cv614_10626.txt  " mouse hunt " may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original " home alone . " 


pos/cv227_24215.txt

pos/cv227_24215.txt the " submarine " genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt think about it . . . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say " ugh , another submarine movie " like people tend to say " ugh , another boxing movie " . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt it's tense , exciting and fascinating . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt once the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder " ok , now how do they get out of this ? " . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt i only have two minor complaints about the entire film . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt i mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ? 
pos/cv227_24215.txt because of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom ! 
pos/cv227_24215.txt my other gripe would be during the film's finale . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt there's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt i cannot stress this enough . . . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt yes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you " that couldn't happen " , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . 
pos/cv227_24215.txt it succeeds fantastically .

pos/cv218_24352.txt

pos/cv218_24352.txt when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt such was the case with frequency . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt it looked awful . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt it looked like a flop . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt frequency boasts a compelling story line . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt including john's mother . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? 
pos/cv218_24352.txt is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ? 
pos/cv218_24352.txt yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt most films are like that . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . 
pos/cv218_24352.txt it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .

pos/cv456_18985.txt

pos/cv456_18985.txt it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt but nothing entirely groundbreaking . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt most of the characters are amusing without being forced . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt there are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt as the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt still , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt i never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . 
pos/cv456_18985.txt parents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .

pos/cv040_8276.txt  " he's back , and it's about time . " 
pos/cv040_8276.txt was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the motto was well chosen . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt is it the acting ? 
pos/cv040_8276.txt hell , no ! 
pos/cv040_8276.txt paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the only problem with the acting is eric roberts . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . " 
pos/cv040_8276.txt but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt dress . . . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt for the occasion . " 
pos/cv040_8276.txt you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! 
pos/cv040_8276.txt he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt is this problem the kisses to the past ? 
pos/cv040_8276.txt they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt is it the script or the movie as a whole ? 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt so what is it ? 
pos/cv040_8276.txt simple : no plot . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt virtually no plot . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . 
pos/cv040_8276.txt that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me . 


pos/cv089_11418.txt

pos/cv089_11418.txt robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt it's a minor , but irritating , flaw . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . 
pos/cv089_11418.txt still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . 


pos/cv697_11162.txt

pos/cv697_11162.txt another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt and all of this is great fun . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the script , by favreau , is great . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) 
pos/cv697_11162.txt there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) 
pos/cv697_11162.txt mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the acting is superb . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt firstly , the running time is a bit too short . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! 
pos/cv697_11162.txt also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . 
pos/cv697_11162.txt but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy .
