neg/cv653_2107.txt some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt the real mccoy is both . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt she soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt j . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . * 
neg/cv653_2107.txt contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt karen's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt small world , eh ? 
neg/cv653_2107.txt then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt only kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt there is no tension in the scene , just tedium . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt like karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later . 
neg/cv653_2107.txt tempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation . 


neg/cv903_18981.txt

neg/cv903_18981.txt don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt any moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt this movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt oh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt but i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt i think not . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? 
neg/cv903_18981.txt i think not . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt in many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . 
neg/cv903_18981.txt another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you . 


neg/cv418_16562.txt

neg/cv418_16562.txt  " payback , " brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's " l . a . confidential " ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( " conspiracy theory " and " lethal weapon 4 , " anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt the tagline for " payback " is , " get ready to root for the bad guy , " and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt just because the protagonist , a " bad guy , " is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will " root for him , " and i didn't . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt since none of the respectable actors in " payback " actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's " ally mcbeal " ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt unger , who made an impression in 1997's " the game , " is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt in the course of the 102-minute running time of " payback , " porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt and guess what ? 
neg/cv418_16562.txt not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , 
neg/cv418_16562.txt even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt  " payback " is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . 
neg/cv418_16562.txt perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . 


neg/cv029_19943.txt

neg/cv029_19943.txt one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt we're still here . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt we're still here . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt if it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt certainly i never expected a remastered print . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . 
neg/cv029_19943.txt but they're menu screens . . .

neg/cv906_12332.txt writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt harder than building a bridge over troubled waters . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt thrillers are all variations on a theme . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt is anyone else getting depressed here ? 
neg/cv906_12332.txt point is , it's not enough to follow the formula . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt the jackal is trying to kill someone . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt gere is trying to stop him . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? 
neg/cv906_12332.txt  ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . ) 
neg/cv906_12332.txt there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , " i wonder what happens next ? " 
neg/cv906_12332.txt the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt no surprise . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt as for the performances . . . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt it wasn't done here . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt do not go see this movie . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt you'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud . 
neg/cv906_12332.txt anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies . 


neg/cv741_12765.txt

neg/cv741_12765.txt several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt the premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt the explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt matthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt frankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt the special effects , such as they are , are execrable . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . 
neg/cv741_12765.txt farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session . 


neg/cv566_8967.txt

neg/cv566_8967.txt i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a " superhero " been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt mr . freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? ) 
neg/cv566_8967.txt notice if the road was on fire ? 
neg/cv566_8967.txt i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt  . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt  . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt  . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn't . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt in fact , it's kind of boring . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , " today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! " ) 
neg/cv566_8967.txt as it is lame-brained ( didn't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt and robin's constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . 
neg/cv566_8967.txt strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a " batman movie , " and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .

neg/cv585_23576.txt the ads make " hanging up " seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt so what do we get ? 
neg/cv585_23576.txt eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt both are slow to show concern . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt  ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) 
neg/cv585_23576.txt the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's " king lear " ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including " desk set " and " there's no business like show business . " 
neg/cv585_23576.txt  ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt i expected to see the credit " cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' " 
neg/cv585_23576.txt and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt the one redeeming aspect of " hanging up " is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt  ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her . 
neg/cv585_23576.txt although leachman is best known for comedies like " young frankenstein " and " the mary tyler moore show , " her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in " the last picture show . " 
neg/cv585_23576.txt bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don't recognize real life anymore .

neg/cv317_25111.txt wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of " the storm of the century . " 
neg/cv317_25111.txt how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? 
neg/cv317_25111.txt not nearly enough . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines ! 
neg/cv317_25111.txt are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? 
neg/cv317_25111.txt fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene " you know what would look good on you ? 
neg/cv317_25111.txt me ! " 
neg/cv317_25111.txt ooooh real creative ) . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . 
neg/cv317_25111.txt i guess i'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? 


neg/cv854_18955.txt

neg/cv854_18955.txt has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ? 
neg/cv854_18955.txt in enemy of the state , that is exactly right . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt will this guy ever get a real role ? 
neg/cv854_18955.txt he has the bruce willis syndrome . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you 
neg/cv854_18955.txt know . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt enemy was one of the worst films of last year . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight , the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me . 
neg/cv854_18955.txt somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .
