neg/cv332_17997.txt there is a rule when it comes to movies . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt a sequel is never as good as the original . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt they made this movie before they were stars . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt  ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . ) 
neg/cv332_17997.txt to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch . 
neg/cv332_17997.txt a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again .

neg/cv295_17060.txt when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , " dangerous liaisons for kids ! " 
neg/cv295_17060.txt it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt and i was impressed . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt wow . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt isn't that a memorable name ? 
neg/cv295_17060.txt i could just say it over and over again . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt sebastian valmont . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt the ones who do are irritating . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the " paradigm of chastity and beauty . " 
neg/cv295_17060.txt so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt but -- dear god ! 
neg/cv295_17060.txt -- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt but i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt the film fails in every other way , too . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt first of all , nobody talks like this . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt even the " intellectuals " i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? 
neg/cv295_17060.txt titillation , of course . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt it can't even work under the pretense of " meaningful love scene , " because we hate the characters . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt it's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt but kids don't act like this . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt nobody acts like this . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound . 
neg/cv295_17060.txt i'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful . 


neg/cv878_17204.txt

neg/cv878_17204.txt the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt it's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? 
neg/cv878_17204.txt james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt he's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt  ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) 
neg/cv878_17204.txt there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt there's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt the plot itself never straightens out . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt the sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? 
neg/cv878_17204.txt on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? 
neg/cv878_17204.txt one too many , i'd imagine . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt foley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt i also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . 
neg/cv878_17204.txt the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . 


neg/cv256_16529.txt

neg/cv256_16529.txt synopsis : a humorless police officer's life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt unfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt meanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt  ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) 
neg/cv256_16529.txt the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt this really isn't a good movie . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
neg/cv256_16529.txt well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt they're awful . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an " action " movie called detonator starring scott baio . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt scott baio ! 
neg/cv256_16529.txt what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
neg/cv256_16529.txt after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt  " maybe it won't be * that * bad " he may say to himself . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt  " perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt lou rawls is even in the mix ! " 
neg/cv256_16529.txt unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt the latter is really too bad . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt silly but kind of neat too . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt i'm sorry . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt this turkey is really cheesy . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt and the creature ! 
neg/cv256_16529.txt yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt cheesy gore . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt that's another main element of watchers reborn . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt finally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as " bot fodder " for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , " mystery science theater 3000 . " 
neg/cv256_16529.txt this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt it also has violence , obviously . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt i wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt instead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz's book . 
neg/cv256_16529.txt trust me , it'll be time much , much better spent .

neg/cv613_23104.txt jack nicholson and martin short ? 
neg/cv613_23104.txt it certainly doesn't have to be funny . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt  " the whole nine yards " is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as " barbecue , " it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt  " the whole nine yards " is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects .

neg/cv613_23104.txt most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals . 
neg/cv613_23104.txt peet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off .

neg/cv241_24602.txt the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt good surprises make movies fun to watch . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt then there are the bad twists . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt screwed perfectly suits the latter description . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt whoops . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt of course , everything that could go wrong does . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! " 
neg/cv241_24602.txt i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt they give real cops bad names . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt he just didn't belong in this movie . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . 
neg/cv241_24602.txt otherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money .

neg/cv860_15520.txt i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad , there would be broken furniture , traces of smack and cocaine on the floor , and a dead prostitute in the bathroom . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad , there might be the same elements present . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt coincidence ? 
neg/cv860_15520.txt poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau ) . . . he is about to marry his radiant fiancee , laura ( cameron diaz ) . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt but before he exchanges his vows , he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt boyd is the ? doer' of the group .

neg/cv860_15520.txt kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura's demanding expectations . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt then , there's moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy , but it presents things in a manner that just aren't funny . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt drugs , mutilation , and killing your own friends isn't something to be laughed at . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt as a straight psychological drama , i could see how it might have worked , as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt if you do like this movie , i don't think that i want to know you . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play . ' 
neg/cv860_15520.txt and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt but her talents are essentially wasted here . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless . 
neg/cv860_15520.txt do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film . 


neg/cv841_3367.txt

neg/cv841_3367.txt a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt and after it , i still can't . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy " mad about you " persona , but he does it well . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another " dating in the 90s " movie . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . 
neg/cv841_3367.txt bye bye love is a genuine shame . 


neg/cv389_9611.txt

neg/cv389_9611.txt ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark's " double team " must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt actually , in " double team , " neither's performance is all that bad . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's " timecop . " 
neg/cv389_9611.txt and rodman . . . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt well , he's pretty much rodman . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt he's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt it's the story that needs some major work . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as " the colony " -- a think tank for soldiers " too valuable to kill " but " too dangerous to set free . " 
neg/cv389_9611.txt quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt so , what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? 
neg/cv389_9611.txt quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks , " double team " should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt and much of what's going on is just wacky . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt did i mention " double team " is strange ? 
neg/cv389_9611.txt when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . 
neg/cv389_9611.txt but we didn't need " double team " to tell us he could do that , did we ? 


neg/cv158_10914.txt

neg/cv158_10914.txt if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! 
neg/cv158_10914.txt indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? 
neg/cv158_10914.txt first , the movie gives us an introductory premise . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt oooh . . . scary ! 
neg/cv158_10914.txt secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary " boo " moments . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt but most of it is just outright silly . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt and this film is unusually gory too . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt he screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt it's moronic fun at best . 
neg/cv158_10914.txt so , if you're hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot .
