neg/cv563_18610.txt the thirteenth floor is a bland , obligatory exercise in genre film-making . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt if i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall , the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one , and characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt the acting is okay , but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of , and features a script ( co-penned by director josef rusnak ) loaded with cliches and stock characters . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt there are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree . 
neg/cv563_18610.txt producer roland emmerich , based on this and his previous directorial efforts , seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science-fiction . 


neg/cv056_14663.txt

neg/cv056_14663.txt unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt what one tough cop lacks is originality . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt this film offers nothing new . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt nothing that you can't get from any cop film . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt too much else is lacking . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt at times , i was hoping to see it . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt one tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . 
neg/cv056_14663.txt but one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . 


neg/cv185_28372.txt

neg/cv185_28372.txt  " the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt there are certainly better things you can do with your time . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt but he's afflicted with loser-itis . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt goats beware ! 
neg/cv185_28372.txt he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt  " it's reverse racism , " he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt this element doesn't work the first time it's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt you don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that " the animal " is tame . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt if there's any reason to see this film , it's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt remember her ? 
neg/cv185_28372.txt she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , " survivor . " 
neg/cv185_28372.txt here , she plays marvin's sunny love interest . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt while her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt with her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making . 
neg/cv185_28372.txt it's too bad that she's in such a mediocre offering 


neg/cv760_8977.txt

neg/cv760_8977.txt when considering david fincher's latest film , " the game " , four words come to mind . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt  " don't believe the hype . " 
neg/cv760_8977.txt this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of " seven " , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt this isn't simply virtual reality . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt this is real life with a deadly twist . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt conrad has a special birthday present for his brother . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt  " they make your life fun , " conrad tells him . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , " fantasy role-playing , " as he calls it . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt one of those films , " basic instinct " , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt the premise of " the game , " is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , " total recall . " 
neg/cv760_8977.txt in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt  " don't believe the hype . " 
neg/cv760_8977.txt  " the game " is not a thrilling roller coaster ride . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? 
neg/cv760_8977.txt no ? well , how about sharon stone ? 
neg/cv760_8977.txt thought so ) . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt there is no suspense here . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt trust me , i looked hard to find some . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt there are those that might say " the game " is not intended to be viewed literally . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt he is charged by his paranoia . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt he is looking at the world through new eyes . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt at the outset , we're told each " game " is tailored to the individual . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt ultimately , this " game " is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt i wanted to like this film more than i did . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt bryan singer's " the usual suspects " for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt also , there is the underrated " jacob's ladder , " with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt here are two examples of films that don't simply manipulate for manipulations' sake . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt one major issue that comes up in " the game " is whether or not the whole " illusion " is just a highly sophisticated con game . 
neg/cv760_8977.txt well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . 


neg/cv984_14006.txt

neg/cv984_14006.txt while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? 
neg/cv984_14006.txt easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt _dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . 
neg/cv984_14006.txt like a zombie . 


neg/cv529_10972.txt

neg/cv529_10972.txt there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a " wiseguy " . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt  ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a " damn you mcbain ! " 
neg/cv529_10972.txt i hear from springfield way ? ) 
neg/cv529_10972.txt so the movie is cliched . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? 
neg/cv529_10972.txt well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt donnie brasco fails on both counts . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt the consequences are painful to watch . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . 
neg/cv529_10972.txt who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? 
neg/cv529_10972.txt but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all . 


neg/cv730_10729.txt

neg/cv730_10729.txt how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ? 
neg/cv730_10729.txt in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this ? 
neg/cv730_10729.txt honestly , i'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ? 
neg/cv730_10729.txt truth be known , i don't really think i can answer this question . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt unless you're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them .

neg/cv730_10729.txt they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt all five of the girls have these " spicy " names for which they are better known than their real names . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt they don't take themselves too seriously , and that's probably the best thing about them . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt they're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music , while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud ! 
neg/cv730_10729.txt if you're a big fan of the group , you probably won't get enough of what you want , and if you're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than " look at us " moments . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt for the right crowd , the " music video " sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film wasn't meant to be acted seriously . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt while this film is continuously compared to the beatles' a hard day's night , i think that is an unjust comparison . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i don't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt i don't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt and what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ? 
neg/cv730_10729.txt probably nothing , and so it is . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn't even give a good review . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt it's bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick . 
neg/cv730_10729.txt if that's the case , the movie's gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick ! 
neg/cv730_10729.txt you might be saying , " a spice girls movie ? 
neg/cv730_10729.txt come on ! " , but when it comes down to it , i think that's the point .

neg/cv109_22599.txt nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie , " " beetlejuice , " " batman , " " edward scissorhands , " " ed wood , " " mars attacks ! " 
neg/cv109_22599.txt -- yet none of them have been horror films . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  " sleepy hollow " is his first attempt to actually scare people . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt i left disappointed . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story " the legend of sleepy hollow . " 
neg/cv109_22599.txt in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt my reaction : ho-hum . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt well , he's a guy without a head . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt on a horse ( boo ! ) . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt the performances are also awful . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only " bram stoker's dracula " and " mary shelley's frankenstein . " 
neg/cv109_22599.txt coppola is an executive producer for " sleepy hollow , " and the script reflects his interest in early forms of " moving pictures , " particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt  ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . 
neg/cv109_22599.txt when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) 
neg/cv109_22599.txt bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy .

neg/cv925_9459.txt everybody in this film's thinking of alicia . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the " cryin' " video . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt this is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt first off , there's zero sex , almost no nudity , and it's not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt well , anyway . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the " plot . " 
neg/cv925_9459.txt alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters' thoughts , except alicia's . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in " mallrats , " and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from " suburbia " ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt somethine like that . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters' thoughts . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt we get to see jeremy and nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt it even shows them in bed together . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt yea . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in " flirting with disaster . " 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt like we care about any of the characters . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she's alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt so i guess she's some kind of mystery or something . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt but she is never explored further . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt i mean , there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they're just as good as sleeping pills . 
neg/cv925_9459.txt and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film .
