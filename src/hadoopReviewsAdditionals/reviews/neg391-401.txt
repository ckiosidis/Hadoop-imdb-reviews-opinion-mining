neg/cv518_14798.txt well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt i don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt but in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt the film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt wayne and garth , these two are not . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt rather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt driving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt `have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt just as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt and , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt their sad lives take on a whole new direction . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt but their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt actually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt alas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt thus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt there's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt to take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt this creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt she's educated and a forebearing witch . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt meanwhile , doug is a complete loser . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt how did these two ever get together ? 
neg/cv518_14798.txt i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . 
neg/cv518_14798.txt if you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury . 


neg/cv990_12443.txt

neg/cv990_12443.txt man , this was one wierd movie . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt the last half hour ? 
neg/cv990_12443.txt this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it , let's just kill everybody " . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this 
neg/cv990_12443.txt movie becomes 100% horror . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's 
neg/cv990_12443.txt seen it all before and knows when to expect it . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? 
neg/cv990_12443.txt then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt this movie could have been so much better . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . 
neg/cv990_12443.txt there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser . 


neg/cv876_9633.txt

neg/cv876_9633.txt a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 
neg/cv876_9633.txt love . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt so far , so mediocre . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt not that there is much of a romance to begin with . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt  " i can accept failure . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt everyone fails at something . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt but i can't accept not trying . 
neg/cv876_9633.txt it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . "

neg/cv826_12761.txt

neg/cv826_12761.txt written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni 
neg/cv826_12761.txt directed by terry gilliam 
neg/cv826_12761.txt i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed " gonzo " journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt operating under the pseudonyms of " raoul duke " and " dr . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt gonzo " , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's " white rabbit " reaches its climax . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt it's a cheech and chong movie . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt but to what end ? 
neg/cv826_12761.txt much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? 
neg/cv826_12761.txt it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt but i don't want to be too hard on it . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . 
neg/cv826_12761.txt i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . 


neg/cv763_16486.txt

neg/cv763_16486.txt it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt not in these times . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt it's all hokum and nonsense , of course . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt but the filmmakers play it straight . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt he must also be proficient in the martial arts . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt  ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) 
neg/cv763_16486.txt wesley snipes is buff as blade . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt they are more farcical than frightful . 
neg/cv763_16486.txt this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . 


neg/cv801_26335.txt

neg/cv801_26335.txt according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt in the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities . 
neg/cv801_26335.txt  ( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's girlfriend . ) 


neg/cv484_26169.txt

neg/cv484_26169.txt way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his " target " . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his " look here , see " glory . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously " dramatic " . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt or substance . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like " karma is only justice with out the satisfaction " are clever . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt at one point caan laments " need is the ultimate monkey " a line so inexplicable he might as well have said " love is like hippo ass " . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt i've seen porno with better dialogue . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt and some with better plot lines too . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about " faggots " migrating to los angeles . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt you know the routine . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt but those gun shots sure crack like thunder . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson . 
neg/cv484_26169.txt oh how far we've come .

neg/cv955_26154.txt words i thought i'd never write : the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace , wit , and power of the original . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt put the gun to my head , pull the trigger , and put me out of my misery . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt better yet , put the horror genre out of its misery . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt when you've finished watching urban legends : final cut , you'll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting , terrible script , and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt urban legends : final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas ( mainly from the blair witch project and scream ) : fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin , one creepy film school , and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movie's hapless victims . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt urban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted " hitchcock award " which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt one female filmmaker ( jennifer morrison , the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes ) writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to " urban legend " tales . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt suddenly , her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban-legendary homicides , but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt the killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat , looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt why this is scary is never explained . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt of course , the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity's sake . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt urban legends has one minor , recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway ( the security guard , of all people ) . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before , but she's utterly clueless about what's going on around her . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt call it suspension of disbelief . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt this film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt the last decent horror film was the blair witch project , and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction . 
neg/cv955_26154.txt the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich ? , as everyone seems to have forgotten : real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown .

neg/cv547_18043.txt jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons , an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt chan plays separated-at-births boomer and john ma , whose drastically different paths . . . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt aw , forget the plot description , it's not even worth the space . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt but let's face it . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt the scenes where nothing happens in chan's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt in the case of twin dragons , however , the tiresome plot-driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout ( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema ) , " get to the good part already ! " 
neg/cv547_18043.txt most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other's existence from their own acquaintances . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained , but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt the twins' love interests , demure club-singer barbara ( chan-film regular maggie cheung ) and lusty bride-hopeful tammy ( nina li chi ) , get disoriented in all the brouhaha , yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot ( in several shots , in fact , even the make-up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which . ) . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt even chan's so-corny-it's-funny humor is off-kilter in this outing . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they're annoying . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt a case in point : whenever anyone sees the brothers together , they fall to the ground in a dead faint . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt are we laughing yet ? 
neg/cv547_18043.txt as usual , the final showdown is the film's jewel , a tour de force display of chan' s agility and grace . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt never mind that it's not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt it's all good fun , but too little too late . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt perhaps chan's next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies . 
neg/cv547_18043.txt they could call it jackie chan's the final fight scenes , and everybody would go home happy .

neg/cv097_26081.txt another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . 
neg/cv097_26081.txt ummm !
