neg/cv433_10443.txt the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt  " it wasn't me ! " he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt  . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt  . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt fred . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt you know , standard kid movie material . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt why ? 
neg/cv433_10443.txt because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! 
neg/cv433_10443.txt i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt then again , maybe they were asleep . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right . 
neg/cv433_10443.txt a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? 
neg/cv433_10443.txt and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place . 


neg/cv544_5301.txt

neg/cv544_5301.txt one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , " you'd better watch out for the skin deep . " 
neg/cv544_5301.txt i'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don't watch skin deep . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt i never saw edwards' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt you see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt as the movie opens , zach's wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress' hairdresser . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt in response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt if you're turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt zach is a rich , '80s l . a . version of ritter's jack tripper character from " three's company . " 
neg/cv544_5301.txt like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he's the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt to add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt for instance , vincent gardenia's talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt of all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach's wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt because we don't care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt the comedy in skin deep doesn't fare much better . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt most of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt about every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of " dueling " condoms . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt overall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt zach's excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt zach's drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt if he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt if he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt if his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he'll clean up his act . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt the tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter . 
neg/cv544_5301.txt perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep .

neg/cv534_15683.txt although i had not been a viewer of the " rugrats " television series , i went into their first animated feature film , " the rugrats movie , " with a positive attitude . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt the trailer looked cute enough , after all . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt after seeing it , i think the words in my recent " antz " review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995's " the pebble and the penguin , " were a bit premature . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt  " the rugrats movie , " is bottom-of-the-barrel children's fare at its worst , and starts to make , " antz " look good in comparison . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt as in the show , " the rugrats movie , " is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt the head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? 
neg/cv534_15683.txt dill pickles ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt when the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt  " the rugrats movie , " judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt so what did the writers choose to do ? 
neg/cv534_15683.txt why , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course ! 
neg/cv534_15683.txt for the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) , " the rugrats movie , " may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt for an adult , " the rugrats movie , " is a piece of garbage . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt there isn't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt if anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn't to service a more quality film . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt  " the rugrats movie " is doa from the start . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt as said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt for adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt as for me , " the rugrats movie , " is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring . 
neg/cv534_15683.txt parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , " the wizard of oz . " 
neg/cv534_15683.txt that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , " the rugrats movie , " is completely missing .

neg/cv631_4782.txt the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie , but , alas , no caped crusader descends to save * this * film . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt instead , it's a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of " dr . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt jekyll and mr . hyde . " 
neg/cv631_4782.txt for a few , fleeting , maddening moments , director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone , the colors , the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martin's best-selling novel . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt yet it fizzles too quickly ; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt casting is a large part of the problem . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt the story all but collap- ses around ms . roberts-- she doesn't have the range for this kind of drama . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt her accent also comes and goes , though it's nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt  ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that's missed by everyone in the story ! ) 
neg/cv631_4782.txt the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt no terror , no tension ; nothing . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt without any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig's fabulously dreary production design . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt all of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt  ( the pacing in the second-half is especially abominable . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt if you * do * stick it through , your sole reward is a half-hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation . ) 
neg/cv631_4782.txt mr . frears reportedly recut his film several times , missing several release dates in the process . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt  ( obviously , no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt blucher ! ) 
neg/cv631_4782.txt mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month , after muppet treasure island . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt perhaps mr . frears should consult with brian henson on future projects . 
neg/cv631_4782.txt i daresay that even ms . piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts .

neg/cv132_5423.txt  " showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt  " showgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt it's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt there's the demanding producer . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt the loyal friend . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt the bitchy competitor . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt lest i forget the scummy club owner . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt unfortunately , " showgirls " doesn't satisfy in this department . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt verhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt to make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history . 
neg/cv132_5423.txt verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .

neg/cv490_18986.txt

neg/cv490_18986.txt i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt let the investigation begin . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt >from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt the general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time . 
neg/cv490_18986.txt but it just could have been so much better . 


neg/cv614_11320.txt

neg/cv614_11320.txt  " flubber " is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt hypothetically , i mean . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt  " flubber , " as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , " the absent minded professor , " where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as " flubber , " you know , flying rubber ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several " show-stopping " moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in " the abyss . " 
neg/cv614_11320.txt philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to .

neg/cv614_11320.txt a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt yuckity-yuck . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt earlier in '97 , they released " jungle 2 jungle , " an adaptation of a really awful french film , " un indien dans la ville , " which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called " magic . " 
neg/cv614_11320.txt such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt didn't think so . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt those times , he's not bad . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for " hercules , " which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they've been pathetic . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt  " jungle 2 jungle " is probably the worst film i saw last year . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt  " flubber " 's probably second . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt what do they need to do ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt perhaps create something new . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt get writers who can write something that's universally entertaining . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt films like " the parent trap " and " mary poppins " are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . 
neg/cv614_11320.txt what's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? 
neg/cv614_11320.txt and my god , couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ? 


neg/cv004_12641.txt

neg/cv004_12641.txt synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt the narrator states that " this is the story of daryl gleason " and tells the audience that he is the stalker . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " stalked " of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? 
neg/cv004_12641.txt of course not . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . 
neg/cv004_12641.txt if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else .

neg/cv794_17353.txt synopsis : big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt elderly , evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt's boy , in the meantime , and goes completely mental . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt comments : naked souls opens with a naked woman , and the movie makes no illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson's , um , talents . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt if you are really interested in seeing anderson's talents , however , i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape , now available on home video . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt at least with that " movie , " you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like " eclectic . " 
neg/cv794_17353.txt a premise does exist in the movie . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt basically , while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents , she practices her art -- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt her boyfriend , meanwhile , spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will " make a difference to humanity . " 
neg/cv794_17353.txt whatever . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt be grateful . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt after we meet the evil everett longstreet , lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo-jumbo get tossed about , pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out music , and minds get transferred . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt never fear , though , pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ( ahem ) to save her boyfriend in the end . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt unfortunately , no one saves the movie . 
neg/cv794_17353.txt avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller , unless you're in for a good laugh or two .
