pos/cv701_14252.txt seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt [theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 
pos/cv701_14252.txt modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt  " your friends and neighbors " takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 
pos/cv701_14252.txt what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? 
pos/cv701_14252.txt labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word " bastard . " 
pos/cv701_14252.txt somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? 
pos/cv701_14252.txt i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt in what way " your friends and neighbors " is supposed to work is open to interpretation . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . 
pos/cv701_14252.txt still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . 


pos/cv649_12735.txt

pos/cv649_12735.txt the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his " attorney " dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , " riding the wave " of something that seemed special and important . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the " american dream " of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . 
pos/cv649_12735.txt i'm not sure if he's any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .

pos/cv293_29856.txt all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo . com , 
pos/cv293_29856.txt an online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt by december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt by april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt the contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt the film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt in the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls . 
pos/cv293_29856.txt in the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe .

pos/cv237_19221.txt the happy bastard's 30-second review 
pos/cv237_19221.txt big daddy 
pos/cv237_19221.txt happy gilmore as a father ? 
pos/cv237_19221.txt of course ! 
pos/cv237_19221.txt that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt he's a hoot . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . 
pos/cv237_19221.txt again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes .

pos/cv125_9391.txt mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt her mast famous episode , " love's labour lost " , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney 
pos/cv125_9391.txt goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt this is when leder starts to show her true stuff . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt george clooney is a real movie star . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality . 
pos/cv125_9391.txt he'll be around for a while .

pos/cv301_12146.txt roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles . 
pos/cv301_12146.txt both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film . 
pos/cv301_12146.txt the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents . 
pos/cv301_12146.txt life and color maybe , but this is not close's best role . 
pos/cv301_12146.txt she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character .

pos/cv927_10681.txt tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt  " kundun " ( " presence " , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as " mine " . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt comparisons to " seven years in tibet " are inevitable . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt  " kundun " features only native actors and is more of an insider's story . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made " seven years " such an audience-pleaser . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt glossed over in " seven years " , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses " we were just about to change things " after the chinese attack . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( " goodfellas " , " taxi driver " , " casino " ) has shifted gears . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt something of a thematic follow-up to his " the last temptation of christ " , this is his slowest film yet . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt an encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt even with its problems , the " kundun " experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt many people who saw " seven years in tibet " will have a " been there , done that " attitude . 
pos/cv927_10681.txt it's likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . 


pos/cv466_18722.txt

pos/cv466_18722.txt david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt oh , and it's rated g . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt  " did you do it ? " he asks his boy . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt  " no father , i didn't , " ronnie answers . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt so do we . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt we pity the man , but we also like him . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? 
pos/cv466_18722.txt if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt it is the epitome of subtlety : it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt he is almost a national treasure . 
pos/cv466_18722.txt his films deserve their own genre .

pos/cv478_14309.txt saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt and what battle scenes they are ! 
pos/cv478_14309.txt they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt the film never really makes any profound statements . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt still , the script could of been a lot better . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . 
pos/cv478_14309.txt it really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie .
