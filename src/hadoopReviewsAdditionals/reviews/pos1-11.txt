pos/cv052_29378.txt synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt because of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt  " memento " traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt review : " memento " is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt an instant film noir classic , " memento " is virtually flawless . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt although the idea of starting at the " conclusion " of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the " start " is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt  " memento " is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite " memento " 's challenging gimmick . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . 
pos/cv052_29378.txt  " memento " may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 .

pos/cv230_7428.txt well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' 
pos/cv230_7428.txt i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about " well thats not really possible . " 
pos/cv230_7428.txt you know what ? 
pos/cv230_7428.txt i couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not , really i couldn't . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt it's a freaking movie and i don't want reality thrown in my face . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt i want to be able to see the impossible , the all might " what if " to many reviewers have seen one to many movies ! 
pos/cv230_7428.txt the special effects are the second star to this feature . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground . 
pos/cv230_7428.txt they did an incredible job and come oscar time ( if they remember ) some notice better be thrown there way . 


pos/cv804_10862.txt

pos/cv804_10862.txt satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt  " dr . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt strangelove " ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt  " men in black " ) . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt what's unique about " wag the dog " is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt in this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? 
pos/cv804_10862.txt that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt brean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt they pitch him an idea to " produce " the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt the characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt for example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt since it's all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt but then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , " this is nothing ! " 
pos/cv804_10862.txt by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and " wag the dog " at least succeeds in this respect . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . 
pos/cv804_10862.txt then again , it's a valiant effort . 


pos/cv920_29622.txt

pos/cv920_29622.txt in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , " is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? " 
pos/cv920_29622.txt obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? 
pos/cv920_29622.txt no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic " gasoline fight " accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . 
pos/cv920_29622.txt zoolander's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . 


pos/cv809_5009.txt

pos/cv809_5009.txt driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( " good times " ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . 
pos/cv809_5009.txt the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . 


pos/cv719_5713.txt

pos/cv719_5713.txt with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like " rock and roll ! " 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  ( actually , it's " lock and load " ) , you can't help thinking tarantino . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  " inspired by true events " -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt or so strangely poignant . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt then , chris begins to rob banks . . . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt judd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt when pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt of course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt it is the rational chris that loves guns ( " shooting is about precision , control " ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- " chaos and you and me . . . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt we're a real family " , she notes wryly ) . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt it is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : " buy-more " -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt it's not a perfect film . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt indeed , as in mcnaughton's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly 'realistic' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt the suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick's badlands . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt while pam shares the yearnings of malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the 'normal' , conventional world . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt pam's final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
pos/cv719_5713.txt see it twice .

pos/cv607_7717.txt us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that " back to the future ii " is one of the few exceptions . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking , especially when it comes to the movies . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything's copasetic right ? 
pos/cv607_7717.txt wrong . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt since when do things go according to plan in the " back to the future " movies ? 
pos/cv607_7717.txt there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt instead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt by the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn't seem gratuitous . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt  " back to the future part ii " is a really great adventure movie . 
pos/cv607_7717.txt it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor .

pos/cv095_28892.txt  " crazy/beautiful " suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt after a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special . " 
pos/cv095_28892.txt even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to " tone things down . " 
pos/cv095_28892.txt needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt  " we were trying to make a cautionary tale , " he told newsweek , " and we couldn't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . " 
pos/cv095_28892.txt regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt  " crazy/beautiful " is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for " failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . " 
pos/cv095_28892.txt set in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt every morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt plus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt as with " save the last dance , " " crazy/beautiful " ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt as carlos , hernandez is a revelation . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt aside from its title , the biggest problem with " crazy/beautiful " is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt after carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt still , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . 
pos/cv095_28892.txt  " afterschool special " my ass ? " crazy/beautiful " is the real deal .

pos/cv961_5682.txt the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt in these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess . . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt is just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt at the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt but bess is suffering in this scary religious society . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt we soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt she can't stand the thought of life without her husband . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt we witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? ) 
pos/cv961_5682.txt convincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt an accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt now he can't satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt at first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt imagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the " grand prix du jury " in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the " palme d'or " ) . 
pos/cv961_5682.txt the screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere .

pos/cv981_14989.txt  " no man is an island , " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other things . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt  ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) 
pos/cv981_14989.txt renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt as guidance counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserves mention . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the " right " or the " wrong " choices . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . 
pos/cv981_14989.txt -october , 1998 
pos/cv981_14989.txt  * the excellent collection king's stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) .
