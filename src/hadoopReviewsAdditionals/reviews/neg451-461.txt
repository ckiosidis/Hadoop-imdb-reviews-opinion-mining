neg/cv628_20758.txt writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt and guess what ? 
neg/cv628_20758.txt he succeeds once again ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt it is a drama . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt now on to my review . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he 
neg/cv628_20758.txt missed ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt this kept me interested in watching him at least . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few " titshots " , as they would say back in high school . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , 
neg/cv628_20758.txt wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt well , at least he finally " came out " and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this 
neg/cv628_20758.txt film's your bag ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now 
neg/cv628_20758.txt there's a great shrink movie ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : " three's company " fans alert ! ! ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! 
neg/cv628_20758.txt also , it is to note that the actress was once named " penthouse pet of the month " in march of 1976 . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt she was known as one joann witty back then . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt she's originally from jersey . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? 
neg/cv628_20758.txt you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the " lost ark " , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997's as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) . 
neg/cv628_20758.txt ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan's 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .

neg/cv790_16202.txt america's favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in " bride of chucky , " and their unholy matrimony is something old , nothing new . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers , however , has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up , but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked honeymoon . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt the answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber ( or at least singe it ) lovin' . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt guess they're anatomically correct . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt chucky ( again voiced by brad dourif ) , of course , is the star of the " child's play " series , a my buddy-type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt in " bride , " the plot ( heh ) picks up with his girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) resurrecting chucky's remains ( he was blown up at the end of " child's play 3 " ) with the help of a black arts manual called " voodoo for dummies . " 
neg/cv790_16202.txt silly mortal . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt before long , she's also been reduced to shin-high figurine status , and the plastic incarnations of these one-time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple ( nick stabile and katherine heigl ) with conjugal plans of their own , leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical , soul-transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt along the way , our murderous barbie and ken go through post-marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds - bicker , argue , kiss and make up . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt but when they squabble over who's going to do the dishes , watch out . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt hey , even faux people have got to work through their problems . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two , but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing .

neg/cv790_16202.txt and when a climactic chase scene is needed , one of the dim-bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending ( will " son of chucky " be next ? ) and this is a bizarrely bad 89-minutes at the movies .

neg/cv790_16202.txt to be fair , though , most of " bride of chucky " is on auto-pilot , so it's not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film . 
neg/cv790_16202.txt similarly shaky , the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland , the effects aren't that special and the story is one big groaner .

neg/cv167_18094.txt

neg/cv167_18094.txt so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men , " 1995's " grumpier old men , " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i . e . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  " grumpiest old men " ) . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  " the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt then hilarity ensues . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans , " i . e . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt  " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . ) 
neg/cv167_18094.txt let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . 
neg/cv167_18094.txt let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ) . 


neg/cv166_11959.txt

neg/cv166_11959.txt there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt the stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's " outer space " ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt yes , in terms of acting , the star power is . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt  . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt  . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt well , more like a falling star . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt lost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt it's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population .

neg/cv166_11959.txt earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt john's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) .

neg/cv166_11959.txt dr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to " destroy robinson family " ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? 
neg/cv166_11959.txt chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt that's just her normal voice ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt in yet another example of a " friend " faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt graham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt hurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt if hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt johnson isn't dull , he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt want an example of how cool this kid can be ? 
neg/cv166_11959.txt how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? 
neg/cv166_11959.txt hey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt but alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt why hire an actress ? 
neg/cv166_11959.txt they could've had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt now that would've had some pizzazz ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt lost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt unfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt while the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt then again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt what an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . 
neg/cv166_11959.txt well , danger potential movie goers ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt danger ! 
neg/cv166_11959.txt this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . 


neg/cv447_27334.txt

neg/cv447_27334.txt after the huge success of " the exorcist " in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt needless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt to start the " story " it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan's body , before it is too late . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn't go anywhere . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt louise fletcher is alright for what it's worth , but she could have done a lot better than this . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt the direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn't figure out . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt in fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt for those exorcist fans who haven't seen this one , i recommend renting it . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt i actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else ! 
neg/cv447_27334.txt im not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere . 
neg/cv447_27334.txt bad , bad , bad movie .

neg/cv462_20788.txt in double jeopardy , the stakes are high . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt `alex , i'll take homicide for $400 . . . ' 
neg/cv462_20788.txt libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt and now , back to the plot . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt who may still be alive . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt yes , you heard right . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt does . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer' . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt hmmm . . . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt perhaps this would have made a good comedy . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt it's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line . 
neg/cv462_20788.txt  ? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't fool most children . 


neg/cv264_14108.txt

neg/cv264_14108.txt if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt my , how easily does the worm turn . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt boring . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt these characters are about as generic as those descriptions . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? 
neg/cv264_14108.txt even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt this tacked-on " romance " would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt they fail on both counts . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . 
neg/cv264_14108.txt the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . 


neg/cv918_27080.txt

neg/cv918_27080.txt you know something , christmas is not about presents . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt it's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt at least that would seem to be the message of " the grinch , " which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt you know the plot : there's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt the movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt it's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that's the case when jones' version is compared to ron howard's . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing " mr . grinch " ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch's wide , toothless grin . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt young wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? 
neg/cv918_27080.txt the grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch's rival for martha's affection . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt the casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt jim carrey seems woefully miscast . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt while his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt his accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from " south park . " 
neg/cv918_27080.txt not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch's home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt needless to say , his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding " santa " in her living room stealing the tree ) . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt however , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . 
neg/cv918_27080.txt bottom line : when you're stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . 


neg/cv423_12089.txt

neg/cv423_12089.txt from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt nice to see you , jim . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt leading off this inning is john warren . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt what's it about ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to " the show . " 
neg/cv423_12089.txt with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : can we guess who wins ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt they're not just boring ; they're lackluster . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : warren fouls off a fastball . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt 1 and 1 . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : not one , from start to finish . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : here's the 1-1 pitch . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! 
neg/cv423_12089.txt the count goes to 1 and 2 . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : yes . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt they have no depth . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's " wild thing . " 
neg/cv423_12089.txt we don't really miss them , though . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : breaking ball , low and outside . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt 2 and 2 . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ? 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : that's right . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt even the minor league seasons are already underway . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt don't bother with major league : back to the minors . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt it's a wretched time- waster . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt wh : thanks for the advice . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt jb : you're welcome . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hc : and here's the 2-2 pitch . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt fouled back , right into this booth . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt hey , jim , heads up ! 
neg/cv423_12089.txt oops . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt somebody better get him some ice for that . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . 
neg/cv423_12089.txt anyway , back to the action on the field ?
