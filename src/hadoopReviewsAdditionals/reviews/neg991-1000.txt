neg/cv703_17948.txt these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about " modern stone age " family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age " town " of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as " high concept " . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . 
neg/cv703_17948.txt all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . 


neg/cv820_24157.txt

neg/cv820_24157.txt `the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt i chuckled incessantly , all the way home . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt let me share . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? 
neg/cv820_24157.txt but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt but not the script . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt `the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt will they never take this watch off ? 
neg/cv820_24157.txt and what if they forget it by their bedside ? 
neg/cv820_24157.txt perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt gee , why not member t-shirts ? 
neg/cv820_24157.txt but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt they are given official skull paddles . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt facing the opposite way means a disagreement . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? 
neg/cv820_24157.txt hell no . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt but not entirely . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt and then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt mcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt let's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt it makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls' gets little accomplished . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt we've seen it all before , and better . 
neg/cv820_24157.txt `the skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded' seems just too generous . 


neg/cv684_12727.txt

neg/cv684_12727.txt any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt this is a very bad sign . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt  ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest . ) 
neg/cv684_12727.txt ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt  ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't . ) 
neg/cv684_12727.txt steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he's gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt at least viggo mortensen ( g . i . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt the thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of " poirot , " as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily's best friend . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . 
neg/cv684_12727.txt it's just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . 


neg/cv250_26462.txt

neg/cv250_26462.txt a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt in other words , she has to be in control of things . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he's a loafer . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt she visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt you can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he's hired as a regular on the show . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he's a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt cliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt it was an insult to one's intelligence . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt if the film wasn't terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . 
neg/cv250_26462.txt its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .

neg/cv036_18385.txt among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt the actors that play them don't help either . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . 
neg/cv036_18385.txt ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

neg/cv309_23737.txt because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy ! 
neg/cv309_23737.txt at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! 
neg/cv309_23737.txt the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of " the x-files . " 
neg/cv309_23737.txt bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt four writers are credited with contributing to the story . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt that doesn't seem possible . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt despite being a solid two hours long , " return to me " adds little to the " boy meets girl / boy loses girl " formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on " the x-files " comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt the only redeeming quality of " return to me " is its hilarious supporting cast . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , " this is bob ! 
neg/cv309_23737.txt his wife is dead ! " 
neg/cv309_23737.txt the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast . 
neg/cv309_23737.txt bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi . 


neg/cv201_7421.txt

neg/cv201_7421.txt i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . 
neg/cv201_7421.txt the best way i can put it is that it's funky . 
neg/cv201_7421.txt i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ? 
neg/cv201_7421.txt it's just like that . 
neg/cv201_7421.txt anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . 
neg/cv201_7421.txt this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . 
neg/cv201_7421.txt it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me .

neg/cv187_14112.txt 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt i , however , would rather cut to the chase . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt they are so wrong . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt the picture has been assembled by mark christopher . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt 54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt  ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) 
neg/cv187_14112.txt but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt why his " friends " push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are " friends " is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status ) . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! 
neg/cv187_14112.txt this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt this one doesn't . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt the rest of the performances are wasted . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt i've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt frankly , i don't care . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt it's easy to recreate something technical like this . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt aside from myers' performance , 54 is a complete failure . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt it's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt it doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt so , don't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . 
neg/cv187_14112.txt everything else i said was just padding .

neg/cv289_6239.txt i've heard it called " jaws with claws " and that's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . 
neg/cv289_6239.txt director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . 
neg/cv289_6239.txt they've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . 
neg/cv289_6239.txt the movie doesn't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest . 
neg/cv289_6239.txt in fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie . 
neg/cv289_6239.txt how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can't even hit the damned thing ? 
neg/cv289_6239.txt or the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ?
