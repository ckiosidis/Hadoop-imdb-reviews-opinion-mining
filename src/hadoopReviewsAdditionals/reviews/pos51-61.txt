pos/cv652_13972.txt kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt  " detective story " features one of kirk douglas's finest performances . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt secrets i would not dream of giving away . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt with a name like " detective story " , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of " nypd blue " , but it doesn't quite work out that way . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt the performances all around are fantastic . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt which brings me back to douglas . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . 
pos/cv652_13972.txt kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these days : he's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior .

pos/cv560_17175.txt oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in a perfect world , " a civil action " would be a breath of fresh air . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt hell , " a civil action " is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes " the firm , " the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt weird . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired " search for bobby fischer " ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than " schindler's list . " 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't " schindler's list " just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt  " a civil action " is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt point two , it has been through several lawyers . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in " wilde , " pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , " fargo " ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i 
pos/cv560_17175.txt suppose like a grisham novel ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt it only feels like half of that . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt maybe even less . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt call it the zallian effect . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt same thing happened with " schindler's list " ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . 
pos/cv560_17175.txt if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , " schindler's list , " though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . 


pos/cv767_14062.txt

pos/cv767_14062.txt is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ? 
pos/cv767_14062.txt it's quite possible . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt his career spanned over 40 years , and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt yet , when he is talked about in the media , he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt and that's really a shame . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt  " the naked spur " features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt it's a western , which stewart specialized in around this period , and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt before he finds that man , though , he runs into two men who agree to help him , thinking he is a sheriff . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt when the criminal is eventually caught , the two men discover stewart's secret , and decide they want a piece of the action too . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal , well played by janet leigh . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt we're never too sure who's side she's really on until the end . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the " shower lady " from " psycho " , and that's unfair . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt stewart gives a performance unlike anything i've ever seen from him . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs , but here , he gets downright hysterical at times . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a " nice guy " . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt his performance borders on psychotic at times , but i loved watching every second of it . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt it's roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do . 
pos/cv767_14062.txt he was an actor unafraid to take chances , and even ruin his public image .

pos/cv637_1250.txt director : penelope spheeris ( decline of western civilization ii - the : metal years , dudes , & suburbia ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt cast : mike myers ( wayne campbell ) , dana carvey ( garth algar ) , : rob lowe ( benjamin oliver ) , tia carrere ( cassandra ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt summary : wayne and garth have a public access show called " wayne's : world . "

pos/cv637_1250.txt benjamin wants to turn the : show into a big hit nationwide , possibly destroying the : essence of " wayne's world " in the process . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt [expectations - medium] 
pos/cv637_1250.txt long review =========== 
pos/cv637_1250.txt i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be " fluff . " 
pos/cv637_1250.txt however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt  ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad . ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very " parodyish . " 
pos/cv637_1250.txt  ( okay , bad term . ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more " canadian " type of mode . ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt direction : spheeris is a classic " music " movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt  ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . ) 
pos/cv637_1250.txt she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl's skits to go see this film in the theatres . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt however , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt you definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt without a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt it'll make tons 'o' dough for everyone involved . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt let's just hope they make a thousand sequels . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt [sorry , i had to get the lame joke in . . . 
pos/cv637_1250.txt forgive me . ] 


pos/cv949_20112.txt

pos/cv949_20112.txt steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for " the new yorker , " several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called " in search of the wily filipino . " 
pos/cv949_20112.txt now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called " chubby rain , " about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt  ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) 
pos/cv949_20112.txt when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble " white code " in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta " clearing . " 
pos/cv949_20112.txt not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt  ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) 
pos/cv949_20112.txt martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading " cahiers du cinema , " or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem " chubby rain , " z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt  ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) 
pos/cv949_20112.txt these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt as i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt that said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . 
pos/cv949_20112.txt martin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? 
pos/cv949_20112.txt for those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . 


pos/cv074_6875.txt

pos/cv074_6875.txt mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) 
pos/cv074_6875.txt with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt i'm not entirely sure why , exactly . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in 
pos/cv074_6875.txt a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but 
pos/cv074_6875.txt after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . ) 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " drunken master " 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and 
pos/cv074_6875.txt is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and 
pos/cv074_6875.txt it's often as funny as anything , too . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these 
pos/cv074_6875.txt schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt but they're still hilarious as ever . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and 
pos/cv074_6875.txt it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's 
pos/cv074_6875.txt not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . " 
pos/cv074_6875.txt on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " gone with the wind " , this isn't . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt it's much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt you might very well like it . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt  " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt if you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if 
pos/cv074_6875.txt nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt if you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . 
pos/cv074_6875.txt all in all , i give this film an .

pos/cv429_7439.txt that thing you do ! , from first-time film director tom hanks , is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band , the wonders , that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt but , the question arrises , will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one-hit wonder , or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ? 
pos/cv429_7439.txt the " oneders " , as they are originally known , have their first gig at a very small-time contest . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt jimmy , the lead singer , has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest .

pos/cv429_7439.txt he seems to fit in well , until the group takes the stage . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt when they begin to play , guy's beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt it looks as though the group is doomed to failure . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt but , the " new " song is a hit ! 
pos/cv429_7439.txt this leads to another gig , and soon enough , the group has an agent . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt he doesn't do too much for them , but they do get their song played on the radio . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt eventually , mr . white of playtone records approaches the group , and he informs them that they want to release a record . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt before you can say " billboard " , the band is now renamed " the wonders " and the members are speeding their way to fame . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt the gigs are getting better , their fame is increasing , and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt the band is invited to appear in a feature film , and , they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt after the appearance on television , things start to fall apart . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt two of the members of the band pretty much disappear , and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy .

pos/cv429_7439.txt that thing you do ! , complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic , is a fun and enjoyable movie that , although it doesn't become clear if it wants to be a comedy , drama , or romance , is a well-made look into the world of music . 
pos/cv429_7439.txt tom hanks' directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him . 


pos/cv955_25001.txt

pos/cv955_25001.txt cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's " black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks " to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , " blaxploitation , " died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt  ( jackson also has little to " do " in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) 
pos/cv955_25001.txt that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence . 
pos/cv955_25001.txt what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . 


pos/cv345_9954.txt

pos/cv345_9954.txt alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt  ( title ) . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt a shot of an alien egg . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt  ( title ) . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt alien legs stretch up into the air . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt  ( title ) . . . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt and so on and so on . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt ripley is revived and asks to see the ship . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt and this is where alien 3 succeeds . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt >from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt as a result , no weapons are to be found . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future .

pos/cv345_9954.txt sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt it's quite touching really . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately .

pos/cv345_9954.txt the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex .

pos/cv345_9954.txt while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . 
pos/cv345_9954.txt it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) .

pos/cv924_29540.txt the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt i mean that as the highest compliment . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles " bud " tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt a pall is cast on the whole affair . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt or they're reduced to comedic buffoons . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt we feel for him . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt he's a decent man . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . 
pos/cv924_29540.txt however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .
