pos/cv054_4230.txt up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those " look who's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size isn't everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt four words : contract with the devil . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's " contract with america . " 
pos/cv054_4230.txt no , satan is much more humane . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt how do i know ? 
pos/cv054_4230.txt i own the document in question . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ? 
pos/cv054_4230.txt get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from " who's the boss ? " 
pos/cv054_4230.txt to speechless . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt it works in this case , unlike " who's the boss ? " 
pos/cv054_4230.txt although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . 
pos/cv054_4230.txt are you getting this , shorty ?

pos/cv891_6385.txt in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , " so i signed up . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? 
pos/cv891_6385.txt you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film " sequels " do to their predecessors . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt and it's a big one . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt >from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt again . . . there's 
pos/cv891_6385.txt nothing new here . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt and yet there doesn't need to be . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together . 
pos/cv891_6385.txt once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .

pos/cv958_12162.txt

pos/cv958_12162.txt the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt the " father " and " daughter " eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt the decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt production designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt the younger members of the cast fare less well . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt not even reaching the " touching " level is the cosette-marius pairing . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . 
pos/cv958_12162.txt even so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . 


pos/cv689_12587.txt

pos/cv689_12587.txt it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of " the horse whisperer , " the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to " projection difficulties . " 
pos/cv689_12587.txt robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with " titanic , " but is only now making its much anticipated debut . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt this ( strategic ? ) 
pos/cv689_12587.txt delay has allowed " the horse whisperer " to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt no matter . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt whatever the reasons for its postponement , " the horse whisperer " supports the old adage " better late than never . " 
pos/cv689_12587.txt redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt while parts of " the horse whisperer " are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial " travelogue " that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt dianne wiest , chris cooper ( " lone star " ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt redford's canvas is huge and exquisite . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since " the horse whisperer " is " dances with wolves " by way of " out of africa " ( oscar winners both for barry ) . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt fortunately , barry's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt  " the horse whisperer " is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . 
pos/cv689_12587.txt the wait , it turns out , was well worth it . 


pos/cv845_14290.txt

pos/cv845_14290.txt when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late '92/early '93 . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt maybe they live in dick clark's pool house . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the supporting performances are also good . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . 
pos/cv845_14290.txt fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . 


pos/cv470_15952.txt

pos/cv470_15952.txt  " love is the devil " is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt exactly what was i looking at ? 
pos/cv470_15952.txt watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt directed ( and written ) by john maybury , " love is the devil " is stylish masterpiece for the senses . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt as such , there is no real story . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( " champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , " he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt  " love is the devil " chronicles the latter part of his life . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt while creating bacon's world of friends ( like " high art , " this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's " battleship potemkin " ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i guess that explains the title . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt a bit . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i can't say i totally enjoyed " love is the devil , " though . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt as such , i respect the way the film looks . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with " what dreams may come " and " dark city , " it's the year's most visually stunning film . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . 
pos/cv470_15952.txt then i would have had something to hold me over even now . 


pos/cv302_25649.txt

pos/cv302_25649.txt aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt griffith ( thematically speaking ) . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt there is not a single likable character in the film . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt there are no " winners " at the end of this film either . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls . 
pos/cv302_25649.txt it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely . 


pos/cv159_29505.txt

pos/cv159_29505.txt with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt the parallels don't end there , either . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt i won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt goldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt it's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt and robert blake ) . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt well , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . 
pos/cv159_29505.txt 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements 


pos/cv507_9220.txt

pos/cv507_9220.txt capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt most comedies these days have one flaw . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt they're not funny . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt the son goes with them , of course . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt he gets the wish . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt what happens next is sidesplitting . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , " no ! 
pos/cv507_9220.txt i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze ! 
pos/cv507_9220.txt all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! " 
pos/cv507_9220.txt he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it's a limited one . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt he uses it to great effect in this movie . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey's character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ? 
pos/cv507_9220.txt it's not even part of the movie's real agenda . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt thankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt maybe they were being merciful , on reflection . 
pos/cv507_9220.txt if i'd laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung . 


pos/cv018_20137.txt

pos/cv018_20137.txt having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt the story begins in hollywood in 1947 . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ' 
pos/cv018_20137.txt `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt also bob hoskins' performance should be credited . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . 
pos/cv018_20137.txt do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . "
