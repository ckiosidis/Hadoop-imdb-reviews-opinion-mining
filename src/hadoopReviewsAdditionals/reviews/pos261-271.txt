pos/cv876_9390.txt usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt others will mention meg ryan . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt but for me , it's not even close . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt and it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory's that never moved to america . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town's annual matchmaking festival . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt things get off to a rocky start for marcy though . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt the movie runs into a few roadblocks . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt for instance , the story is very thin . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt the strange thing is that it works . 
pos/cv876_9390.txt garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .

pos/cv837_27325.txt in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : " five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . " 
pos/cv837_27325.txt that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . 
pos/cv837_27325.txt the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . 


pos/cv623_15356.txt

pos/cv623_15356.txt i feel no hesitation in saying that " there's something about mary " is the best film that i will see all year . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt it is that good of a film . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt when gene siskel said this about " fargo " only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? 
pos/cv623_15356.txt but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt now for the shocker ; " mary " is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( " pink flamingos " obviously notwithstanding ) . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt forget " blazing saddles " , " animal house " and even the former king of gross-out comedy , " monty python's meaning of life " ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is " monty python and the holy grail " ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of " mary " ; it has a huge heart . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt it's funny , though . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt but believe me , it is anything but . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from " scream " ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt jump to the present . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? 
pos/cv623_15356.txt somehow , the farrelly's pull it off . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt the performances here are also right on target . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic " saving private ryan " . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ? 
pos/cv623_15356.txt i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . 
pos/cv623_15356.txt there is just something about " mary " . 


pos/cv269_21732.txt

pos/cv269_21732.txt this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt receiving a summer grant to study " chemo-electric therapy , " geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , " why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? " 
pos/cv269_21732.txt she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt what is progress ? 
pos/cv269_21732.txt what can one expect out of life ? 
pos/cv269_21732.txt is the small farmer about to become extinct ? 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , " make the world go away " blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . 
pos/cv269_21732.txt perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

pos/cv744_10038.txt eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old " masterpiece " from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time .

pos/cv744_10038.txt she's also dealing with feelings she hasn't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the " savage " humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating .

pos/cv744_10038.txt it's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s . 
pos/cv744_10038.txt all the elements are there -- memorable songs like " under the sea " and " kiss the girl , " cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children .

pos/cv590_19290.txt based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to " blame canada , " wage war against the neighbor country and execute " terrence and phillip , " the flatulent actors in the obscene film .

pos/cv590_19290.txt satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like " shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er " and " cartman's mom is a big fat bitch " . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i . e . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the " blame canada " plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt the distinctively low-tech " cardboard " animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art " deep canvas " technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt perhaps not . 
pos/cv590_19290.txt having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie .

pos/cv191_29719.txt i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt the story of serendipity is simple . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt sara declares that if this " thing " -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that " thing " was right after all . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters 
pos/cv191_29719.txt on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand . 
pos/cv191_29719.txt but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . 


pos/cv556_14808.txt

pos/cv556_14808.txt steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and " oscar " -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt together with other young directors of his " new hollywood " generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of " blockubuster " philosophy . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book " ufo experience " by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - " close encounters " - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for " oscar " as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . 
pos/cv556_14808.txt anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . 


pos/cv020_8825.txt

pos/cv020_8825.txt by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt that is until about half-way through the movie . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt but this is as close as you will ever get to it . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " 
pos/cv020_8825.txt at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt the last half of the film is very well done . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " 
pos/cv020_8825.txt before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . 
pos/cv020_8825.txt although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .

pos/cv435_23110.txt

pos/cv435_23110.txt there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with " the hurricane . " 
pos/cv435_23110.txt this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin " hurricane " carter would normally be called " norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' " as per the tradition of referring to a film " belonging " to a director . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of " the hurricane , " because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the book , entitled " the sixteenth round , " opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt  " the hurricane " leans on denzel washington . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt  " the hurricane " moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from " raging bull , " get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt jewison's best achievement in " the hurricane " is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt there is much to interest a viewer in " the hurricane , " but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the canadians are good . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the cops are bad . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( " hate put me in prison . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt love's gonna bust me out . " ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt it's too bad . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than " he's a racist pig . " 
pos/cv435_23110.txt i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt criticism has been levied against the liberties " the hurricane " takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt of course , " the hurricane " works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : " the hurricane " is a highly flawed film . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing " the hurricane " has that actor . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt carter has been quoted as saying , " denzel washington is making me look good , " but he's not the only one . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt washington makes this film look good . 
pos/cv435_23110.txt denzel washington's " the hurricane . " 
pos/cv435_23110.txt sounds pretty good to me .
