pos/cv190_27052.txt good films are hard to find these days . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt great films are beyond rare . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt proof of life is a thinking man's action movie . 
pos/cv190_27052.txt it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .

pos/cv389_9369.txt when i left the theater after seeing david lynch's " lost highway , " i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , " i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . " 
pos/cv389_9369.txt in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture " eraserhead " on the weirdness scale . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt you won't " know " what happened when it's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when " mystery man " ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of " lost highway " are out in full force from beginning to end . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt this description might make " lost highway " sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in " lost highway " it works perfectly . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's " song to the siren " can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically " happening " in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt lynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt the main characters in this " reality " - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen " pulp fiction " wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt it's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt that said , these minor flaws don't prevent " lost highway " from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . 
pos/cv389_9369.txt it is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . 


pos/cv524_23627.txt

pos/cv524_23627.txt even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt what helps final destination is its unique premise . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt this being already has predestined when and how you will die . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? 
pos/cv524_23627.txt this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt however , death isn't through with them yet . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . 
pos/cv524_23627.txt and from this , i had a great time watching the movie . 


pos/cv336_10143.txt

pos/cv336_10143.txt scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt as stipulated by one of the " rules of sequels " uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt paradoxically , there's a lot less gore . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the " true life " events of scream ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the " movie within a movie " sequences . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt stab features heather graham in the " casey becker " role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as " sidney prescott " ( neve campbell ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt it would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt following the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt in addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt there's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt ultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt from the stab scenes to lines like " brothers don't last long in situations like this , " craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt their resolution to the obligatory " whodunit ? " 
pos/cv336_10143.txt is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt  ( " nice twist , " quips the killer . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt  " didn't see it coming , didya ? " ) 
pos/cv336_10143.txt one senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . 
pos/cv336_10143.txt supposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill . 


pos/cv683_12167.txt

pos/cv683_12167.txt melvin van peebles' " sweet sweetback's baadasssss song " was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , " sweet sweetback " was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built " sweet sweetback " from the ground up almost entirely by himself . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases " rated x by an all-white jury , " which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt the storyline in " sweet sweetback " is deceptively simple . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt at the beginning of " sweet sweetback , " he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : " sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . " 
pos/cv683_12167.txt van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , " sweet sweetback " doesn't seem all that revolutionary . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt at that time , " sweet sweetback " was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience " a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . " 
pos/cv683_12167.txt of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt  " sweet sweetback " is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates " sweetback " from other movies like " shaft " ( 1972 ) and " the mack " ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt  " sweet sweetback " is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , " sweet sweetback " is certainly not without its controversies . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt when it was first released , an article was published in " ebony " magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt nevertheless , a movie like " sweet sweetback " cannot be made without conflicting points of view . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt the fact that " sweet sweetback " was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply " the black community " ) . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between " sweet sweetback " and all movies that had come before it . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , " oh lord , let him die . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt don't let them kill him . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt let him die on his own . " 
pos/cv683_12167.txt it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : " watch out ! 
pos/cv683_12167.txt a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . " 
pos/cv683_12167.txt beyond the political aspects , " sweet sweetback " is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . 
pos/cv683_12167.txt he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .

pos/cv163_10052.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? 
pos/cv163_10052.txt is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? 
pos/cv163_10052.txt  ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) 
pos/cv163_10052.txt fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt  ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) 
pos/cv163_10052.txt similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- " under the sea " and " kiss the girl " -- have become the stuff of legend . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled " under the sea " as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad " part of your world " , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . 
pos/cv163_10052.txt the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .

pos/cv862_14324.txt seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
pos/cv862_14324.txt it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt therefore , " gone with the wind " deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt this plays a major factor in the film's success . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt it doesn't simply plug in the " right thing " at the " right time , " it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt getting married just to spite someone ) . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt  " do we have ammunition factories ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt do we have food ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt do we have a navy ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt all we have is tobacco . " 
pos/cv862_14324.txt all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is " marked " for life when her first husband dies . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , " no ! 
pos/cv862_14324.txt not my leg ! 
pos/cv862_14324.txt don't cut off my leg ! " 
pos/cv862_14324.txt another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt all ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt none ? 
pos/cv862_14324.txt either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . 
pos/cv862_14324.txt it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in " gone with the wind , " but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain .

pos/cv854_17740.txt will they turn themselves in ? 
pos/cv854_17740.txt all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film . 
pos/cv854_17740.txt the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun . 
pos/cv854_17740.txt the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film . 
pos/cv854_17740.txt this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs . 
pos/cv854_17740.txt there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films . 
pos/cv854_17740.txt the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying .

pos/cv334_10001.txt arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt but , she does sex scenes alright . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt so , the good guys are awful . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt but , the bad guy's are excellent . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt another irritating thing is the product placement . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) 
pos/cv334_10001.txt overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all . 
pos/cv334_10001.txt in fact , it's very good . 


pos/cv454_2053.txt

pos/cv454_2053.txt it was easy to fear the worst . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt script , you ask ? 
pos/cv454_2053.txt who needs one , kid . . . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt we've got ourselves a formula . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt didn't . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the premise is a simple one . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt and what a pair of performances those leads are . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , " i didn't kill my wife , " with a matter-of-fact , " i don't care , " we know exactly what he means . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt it's his job to bring in a fugitive . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt however , it's time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt the chase is on . 
pos/cv454_2053.txt my advice is to catch it .
