pos/cv971_10874.txt at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : " can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? " 
pos/cv971_10874.txt fucking good question , that . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt and live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he's not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt soon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt  " never do your own stash " , warns one character early in the film . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt where he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt and it perfectly suits the material . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt the only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt it's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt as expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . 
pos/cv971_10874.txt at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it .

pos/cv858_18819.txt mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . ' 
pos/cv858_18819.txt austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' " mojo " , what keeps austin going with spy talents . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only " quasi-evil . " 
pos/cv858_18819.txt dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt dr . evil tells mini me , " you complete me , " in a loving manner . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt dr . evil loving ? 
pos/cv858_18819.txt wow ! 
pos/cv858_18819.txt mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt austin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his " pad " , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , " don't go there , girlfriend ! " 
pos/cv858_18819.txt to the president of the united states . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 
pos/cv858_18819.txt it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , " it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . " 
pos/cv858_18819.txt tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt  ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . 
pos/cv858_18819.txt the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . 


pos/cv143_19666.txt

pos/cv143_19666.txt known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with " pretty woman , " which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt the other winning element that makes " pretty woman " so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , " pretty woman " has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la " cinderella . " 
pos/cv143_19666.txt the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , " pretty woman " is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as " american gigolo " and " an officer and a gentleman , " gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received " mistic pizza " and 1989's " steel magnolia , " for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt after " pretty woman , " roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released " runaway bride , " which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt  " pretty woman " does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . 
pos/cv143_19666.txt helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , " pretty woman " is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . 


pos/cv807_21740.txt

pos/cv807_21740.txt there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt but i doubt that . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt after all , the mystical trip is the journey . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt the little girls are precocious but they are lovable . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . 
pos/cv807_21740.txt and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! 


pos/cv487_10446.txt

pos/cv487_10446.txt in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt from that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills " verbal " kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from " new york's finest taxi service " --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the cast is exceptional . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt byrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt baldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt spacey's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt we do . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt kudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt they both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt however , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt if you haven't seen the movie , rent it . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt watch it . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt then rewind the tape , and watch it again . 
pos/cv487_10446.txt trust me , you'll be amazed .

pos/cv729_10154.txt titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
pos/cv729_10154.txt as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in either case , it is filmmaking at its best . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt amazingly , he was right . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as " the ship of dreams . " 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt peter lamont's sets are more than authentic . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt what a lark . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt we've struck an iceberg . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt now let's get back to our brandy and cigars . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt  " it's good-bye for a little while , " a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt  " this boat's for mommies and children . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt there'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . " 
pos/cv729_10154.txt basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt  " no thanks , " the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt  " we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt but we would like a brandy . " 
pos/cv729_10154.txt titanic runs 3 : 14 . 
pos/cv729_10154.txt it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . 


pos/cv381_20172.txt

pos/cv381_20172.txt bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt no , hilarious . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . 
pos/cv381_20172.txt i wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough . 


pos/cv684_11798.txt

pos/cv684_11798.txt there seem to be two reactions to dark city . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt you either love it or you are unimpressed . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt count me as a " love it . " 
pos/cv684_11798.txt as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt surprised , the attacker runs off . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt now if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt dark city is good on many levels . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt first , the look of the movie is excellent . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt second , the editing of the film is good . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the " amnesia " explained , in satisfying increments . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt third , the special effects are well used . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt a simple ripple effect is used . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt john murdoch's recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt when we finally see the big picture of the movie's world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . 
pos/cv684_11798.txt a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . 


pos/cv016_4659.txt

pos/cv016_4659.txt carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - " i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! " 
pos/cv016_4659.txt bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! 
pos/cv016_4659.txt the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . 
pos/cv016_4659.txt this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! 


pos/cv660_21893.txt

pos/cv660_21893.txt i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt  ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood . ) 
pos/cv660_21893.txt visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt sheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt those anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt and there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt the rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt that this film manages to turn a box marked " 25 cents " into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys .

pos/cv660_21893.txt sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . 
pos/cv660_21893.txt there's somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life .
