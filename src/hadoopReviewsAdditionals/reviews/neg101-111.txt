neg/cv991_19973.txt the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , " etc , etc , etc , " i would cringe . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt literally . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the sole song which is used cleverly is " getting to know you , " which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt you're being hunted by a dragon ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt what do you do ! ? 
neg/cv991_19973.txt sing a happy song ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ? 
neg/cv991_19973.txt believe it ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says " etc . , etc . , etc . , " more and more as the film progresses . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt and where does this character's personality change ? 
neg/cv991_19973.txt hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt isn't that the whole plot ? 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt another one of his teeth fell out ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt hardy-har-har ! 
neg/cv991_19973.txt he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt animated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , " worst movie of the decade . " 
neg/cv991_19973.txt instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it . 
neg/cv991_19973.txt not the slightest bit . 


neg/cv701_15880.txt

neg/cv701_15880.txt the most absurd remake of 1998 ? 
neg/cv701_15880.txt it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) 
neg/cv701_15880.txt there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) 
neg/cv701_15880.txt and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe's demise . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt suffice it to say , the movie could have been called " joe : ape in the city . " 
neg/cv701_15880.txt theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , " look , joe's headed for the movie theatre ! " 
neg/cv701_15880.txt followed by a shot of joe scaling mann's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like " look , joe's headed for an amusement park ! " and what do you know , there's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) 
neg/cv701_15880.txt i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker's make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) 
neg/cv701_15880.txt to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt it's certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe's not on camera may bore them to tears . 
neg/cv701_15880.txt  ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron's colourful array of tank tops . ) 
neg/cv701_15880.txt i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to .

neg/cv938_10706.txt synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt  ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) 
neg/cv938_10706.txt how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt boston has changed dramatically in those ten years . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with " policia " printed on their doors . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt that's it . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt 76 minutes never seemed so long . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt this fake passport drops to the ground . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt must not have been a good fake . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt this emphasizes another fault with the film . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt things just defy common sense . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt don't fear the rush . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt fear the movie . 
neg/cv938_10706.txt watch something else . 


neg/cv806_9405.txt

neg/cv806_9405.txt in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt was it " deep " ? 
neg/cv806_9405.txt nope . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt which was true . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be . " ; 
neg/cv806_9405.txt mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman's body she gets pushed off a building . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt alas , these are only hints . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt there are , don't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . 
neg/cv806_9405.txt a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . 


neg/cv712_24217.txt

neg/cv712_24217.txt preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt michael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york's character . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt here's some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside's character . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt how do they fix that ? 
neg/cv712_24217.txt make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! 
neg/cv712_24217.txt there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt oooooo scary . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt but even that wasn't enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside's character is gay ! 
neg/cv712_24217.txt it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt my main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt anything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren't shown with any sense of urgency or importance . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt for example , at one point york's character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt there's no " world reaction " to anything . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt most documentaries tend to overlook this . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you'll remember his documentary from the 1970's called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt however , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say " ever see raiders of the lost ark ? 
neg/cv712_24217.txt well , our film is like that ! " 
neg/cv712_24217.txt no it isn't . 
neg/cv712_24217.txt not by a long shot .

neg/cv714_19704.txt

neg/cv714_19704.txt do the folks at disney have no common decency ? 
neg/cv714_19704.txt they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt wasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? 
neg/cv714_19704.txt obviously not . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt in the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt as a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt rupert everett ? ! 
neg/cv714_19704.txt only now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt he does still have his cat , though . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt and so is born inspector gadget . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' 
neg/cv714_19704.txt alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt there are so many tired plot additions . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt gadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt well , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt and don't even get me started about the villains . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt the special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt the problem here lies solely in the script . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . 
neg/cv714_19704.txt here is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway . 


neg/cv596_4367.txt

neg/cv596_4367.txt i've got to admit it . . . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt i'm a huge jim carrey fan . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt sadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt once again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt those who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt the original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between . 
neg/cv596_4367.txt they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber .

neg/cv523_18285.txt 1989's " major league " was a delightful surprise . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt that's certainly true of " major league ii " and the most recent entry , " major league : back to the minors . " 
neg/cv523_18285.txt the title is , of course , a contradiction . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt shouldn't it be " minor league ? " 
neg/cv523_18285.txt that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for " major league ii " ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in " league ii " ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins' aaa team , the buzz . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt you can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt there's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films ) . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt sum total : none . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt the entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt gus' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt  ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt  ( wanna guess who wins ? ) 
neg/cv523_18285.txt  " back to the minors " is a movie that has no reason to exist . 
neg/cv523_18285.txt there's hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .

neg/cv691_5090.txt this is the movie that could single-handedly bring " mystery science theater 3000 " out of cancellation . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt it's one of those movies that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious , due in no small part to its big star , supermodel cindy crawford . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt if you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . , you'll change your mind when you see fair game . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt in a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course ) . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt we all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt nonetheless , someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer , but we're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt and for you horny teenage boys out there , you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark . . . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt come to think of it , that may have been a body double . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt cindy crawford isn't black , is she ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt like i said , crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt alec ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt adam ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt there's absolutely nothing original about this movie . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt it's every cop show of the 70's mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90's . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt three decades of crap all in one place , driven further into the ground by crawford's complete lack of acting talent . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt and it's all completely predictable . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the " sexual tension " will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie's going to suck from the first scene . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt the plot isn't really explained until the end . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt in the words of one of the villains , " we even know what size pantyhose she wears . " 
neg/cv691_5090.txt  ( yeah , you and every 14-year-old boy in america . ) 
neg/cv691_5090.txt he goes on to add , " we know more about her than she does . " 
neg/cv691_5090.txt  ( _that_ i find very easy to believe . ) 
neg/cv691_5090.txt i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes , because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( " if it weren't for me , you'd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba ! " ) 
neg/cv691_5090.txt because , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like " i'm very interested in _hard_ware " and other crap about playing with his joystick ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt i wouldn't , but not because i'm a computer nerd . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt it's just not funny . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt crawford's only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords' body . . . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt or was it jack lord's body ? 
neg/cv691_5090.txt i'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt crawford says woodenly , " that was my client's boat you just blew up . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt i'm filing a lawsuit against you . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt you're in big trouble , " or something to that effect , and baldwin replies smugly , " what do i have to do to get out of it ? " 
neg/cv691_5090.txt they of course begin making out and the credits roll . 
neg/cv691_5090.txt i'm not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how , if they'd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say , " you think i could settle out of court ? " 
neg/cv691_5090.txt but i will tell you that , if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her , you quote the final line of the movie to that person : " what do i have to do to get out of it ? "

neg/cv275_28725.txt

neg/cv275_28725.txt porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , " town and country . " 
neg/cv275_28725.txt  " town and country " has a pedigree befitting it's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( " the graduate " ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( " funny bones " ) . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty's next " ishtar . " 
neg/cv275_28725.txt so , is it that bad ? 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the answer is no . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt but it's not very good either . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the major problem with " town and country " is that it's unstructured and random . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples' divorce lawyer ) . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt ellie thinks she's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family's mississippi manse . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they'd never become a couple to begin with . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter's cheating on her . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he's gay . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the four friends , along with every woman porter's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , " the virgin suicides " and tricia vessey , " kiss the girls " ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt porter's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt maybe we're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn't initiate his own sex romps ? 
neg/cv275_28725.txt keaton's ellie has a trusting nature that's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of " the out of towners " and " the first wives' club " while shandling's relegated to true second banana status . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt kinski is bland and unmotivated . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like " hear my song " and " funny bones . " 
neg/cv275_28725.txt the script is this film's weakest link - it's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . 
neg/cv275_28725.txt while " town and country " isn't exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .
