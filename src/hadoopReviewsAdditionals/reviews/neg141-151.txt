neg/cv815_23466.txt when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ? 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt this . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt thing . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i shift uncomfortably in my seat . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted " funny " conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt so explain this . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt this . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt thing . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt what planet are you from ? 
neg/cv815_23466.txt purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying " uh-huh , " and how to compliment shoes . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt whoops , too late . ) 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of " comedy . " 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it isn't funny the first time . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it isn't funny the eighth time . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it isn't funny the eighteenth time . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt wow . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt what a magnificent bastard . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt they get married . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt yup . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt the next day . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! 
neg/cv815_23466.txt bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings " high hopes " ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , " now you can't leave me . " 
neg/cv815_23466.txt we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of " guilt , " but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt what's the message i derive from all this ? 
neg/cv815_23466.txt men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt well , maybe something will click . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt ha ha . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt ha ? 
neg/cv815_23466.txt i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . . 
neg/cv815_23466.txt congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's " title ! " 
neg/cv815_23466.txt award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie's name . 


neg/cv520_13297.txt

neg/cv520_13297.txt i cried during _babe_ . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt i admit it . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a " children's film " --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt such , my friend , is the power of cinema . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt they can't possibly drop the ball on this one . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt can't miss . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt can't possibly miss . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt they missed . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt what went wrong ? 
neg/cv520_13297.txt after much thought , i supply three general rules . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt  ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall's dreadful " preacher's wife " ) . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt betty thomas worked wonders with " the brady bunch movie " , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt  ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , 
neg/cv520_13297.txt  " con air " ) . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt but there's little humor here . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt even the mouth is ill-synched . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt  ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt here , betty thomas is clearly over her head . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt i wish i could commend the special effects , but they're merely average . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt count the number of times where the animal's mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt this is less a " babe " and more of a " look who's barking " clone . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt you may be wondering , 'how does eddie murphy fare ? ' 
neg/cv520_13297.txt well , he came back with the exceptional " nutty professor " , and i don't doubt he can come back again . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt here , he's tied into a straight man and given little to do . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt the exceptions are when he fears he's going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you'd expect routine that he's more adept at . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt it's unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt after all this , what's left ? 
neg/cv520_13297.txt butt jokes . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt a _lot_ of butt jokes . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . 
neg/cv520_13297.txt if there's a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt .

neg/cv866_29447.txt making your first feature film ain't easy . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you're already ahead of the game . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? 
neg/cv866_29447.txt the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt again . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt five irish kids in nyc's hell's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt with teary music . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt and slow motion . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt in the film's first scene . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt he's concerned about buddy jason gedrick's heroin abuse . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin's character's sister . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt but none of this ever really amounts to anything . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt it seems that moresco's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone's been trying to evoke since scorsese's early work . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt  ( do people actually do this ! ? ) 
neg/cv866_29447.txt we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you've seen in movies just like this one before . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it's almost funny . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt moresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt as a result , the movie's style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt moresco needs to either trust his audience's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . 
neg/cv866_29447.txt if he actually gets that chance .

neg/cv662_14791.txt the cover-up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends , two wives and several innocent bystanders . 
neg/cv662_14791.txt this was a real audience pleaser at toronto , but it did not do much for me .

neg/cv662_14791.txt they have one moral person among them ( daniel stern ) , and one totally amoral person ( christian slater ) . 
neg/cv662_14791.txt it is more selfish to let the amoral lead , so they do . 
neg/cv662_14791.txt - this film is strange , but not really funny or biting . 
neg/cv662_14791.txt black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange .

neg/cv662_14791.txt if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation . 
neg/cv662_14791.txt - it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book .

neg/cv645_17078.txt cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m . ali . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt review by : geoff berkshire 
neg/cv645_17078.txt jawbreaker is the very definition of a " rip-off . " 
neg/cv645_17078.txt this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her " foxy " , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into " vylette " , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt up until about this point the film is effective enough . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt fern's rise to popularity is equally lame . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .

neg/cv645_17078.txt they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . 
neg/cv645_17078.txt performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .

neg/cv267_16618.txt

neg/cv267_16618.txt i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's " the company of wolves , " to 1992's " the crying game , " and 1994's " interview with a vampire . " 
neg/cv267_16618.txt his latest film , " the butcher boy , " is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt the premise of , " the butcher boy , " is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt the supporting characters are no help , though . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt the pacing is all off in , " the butcher boy . " 
neg/cv267_16618.txt although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt i'd rather think of , " the butcher boy , " as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film . 
neg/cv267_16618.txt what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore . 


neg/cv102_8306.txt

neg/cv102_8306.txt ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt hackers is guilty of all of these crimes . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt this is the section for mistakes in the movies . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . 
neg/cv102_8306.txt hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . 


neg/cv013_10494.txt

neg/cv013_10494.txt a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt no no . . . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt just kidding . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
neg/cv013_10494.txt in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought " hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . " 
neg/cv013_10494.txt too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * the acting is truly bad . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim " tiny " lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite " utility " actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt in that case , the following critiques also apply : 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt sonya does her " kiss of death , " jax does his " earthquake , " liu kang does his " animality , " and so on . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt silly , silly folks . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt  * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their " animalities . " 
neg/cv013_10494.txt motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . 
neg/cv013_10494.txt you'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . 


neg/cv978_22192.txt

neg/cv978_22192.txt anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt though good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because " the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( " father , have i offended you in some way ? 
neg/cv978_22192.txt why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt he , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt it's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt anna then comes in and cries a bit . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt i liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt foster's generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt yun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam's sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt the cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . 
neg/cv978_22192.txt this is an emotionless costume epic .

neg/cv952_26375.txt  " alcohol and drugs = bad . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt not alcohol and drugs = good . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt got it ? " 
neg/cv952_26375.txt just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt '28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt it is a classic cautionary tale . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt an echo . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt a big , fat and expensive clich ? . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? 
neg/cv952_26375.txt even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt  " all you need to do is just say no " , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt and that's how simple it is ! 
neg/cv952_26375.txt in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt 'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt so what's the point ? 
neg/cv952_26375.txt in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . 
neg/cv952_26375.txt under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .
