pos/cv142_22516.txt it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt soon homer is delivering babies like a professional . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer " continues to have such high expectations of people . " 
pos/cv142_22516.txt such is the result of an insulated upbringing . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt many of which he was unaware needed to be asked . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt calling them " princes of maine , kings of new england " in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt there is a danger in that line of reasoning . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt god has also given us a set of rules . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt and yet , many continue to ignore his " rules " preferring to make up their own as they go through life . 
pos/cv142_22516.txt  " trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . " 
pos/cv142_22516.txt proverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] 
pos/cv142_22516.txt just as a builder follows a designer's blueprint or a conductor follows a composer's score , why shouldn't we follow the rules of life given to us by life's architect for our own blessing ?

pos/cv332_16307.txt like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt on the basis of the overall story , " at first sight " is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , " awakenings . " 
pos/cv332_16307.txt what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt however , what helps " at first sight " rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer " you've got mail " immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual " love scenes , " and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the " big city . " 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt val kilmer , usually cast in the " macho " type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , " mighty aphrodite , " for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's " mimic , " 1998's " the replacement killers " ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with " at first sight " that she finally has another juicy role to play . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the " bad , " one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the one misstep of " at first sight " is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt in " awakenings , " the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . 
pos/cv332_16307.txt since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , " at first sight " comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace .

pos/cv027_25219.txt

pos/cv027_25219.txt the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt but the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt joe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . 
pos/cv027_25219.txt because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

pos/cv825_5063.txt director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it . 
pos/cv825_5063.txt but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie . 
pos/cv825_5063.txt the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama . 
pos/cv825_5063.txt not that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously . 
pos/cv825_5063.txt the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .

pos/cv132_5618.txt quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . 
pos/cv132_5618.txt he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain .

pos/cv132_5618.txt their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . 
pos/cv132_5618.txt instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . 
pos/cv132_5618.txt of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . 
pos/cv132_5618.txt you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined .

pos/cv333_8916.txt in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt does men live up to its press ? 
pos/cv333_8916.txt well , yes it does . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt the reason ? 
pos/cv333_8916.txt both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt  " it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , " he says . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt you can guess which one she falls for . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? 
pos/cv333_8916.txt in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt could it happen in the real world ? 
pos/cv333_8916.txt probably not . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt but does the film work as entertainment ? 
pos/cv333_8916.txt its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . 
pos/cv333_8916.txt there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .
