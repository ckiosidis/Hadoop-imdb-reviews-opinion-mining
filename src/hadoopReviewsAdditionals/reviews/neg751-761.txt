neg/cv380_8164.txt i want to be involved in show business one day . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt this movie proves it for me . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt they didn't . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt this film is different . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt the cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he's one of those directors who's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn't really give an impressive cast anything to do . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt his accent is so heavy , you can't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt that's the trouble with me , * i * notice . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt patrick stewart was the person i'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would've been so much better . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt or sean connery , but not arnold " i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life " schwarzenegger . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would've been nice if they'd casted a star that had talent for the role . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt akiva goldsmith's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt in a regular batman film , they'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt there is talk of a fifth batman movie . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt my interest to see it is low , but i hope it's better than this . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt if you don't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster . 
neg/cv380_8164.txt any other . 


neg/cv271_15364.txt

neg/cv271_15364.txt the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt unfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt it's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt there's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt and , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as " the killer . " 
neg/cv271_15364.txt they're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt and so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . 
neg/cv271_15364.txt god help us .

neg/cv926_18471.txt a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well ) . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i just wanted to see the movie . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt reader , do not misunderstand . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i did not have an anti-hype reaction . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the hype was unavoidable . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt  " who are these jedi knights ? " 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i asked . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt  " why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? " 
neg/cv926_18471.txt  " why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? " 
neg/cv926_18471.txt  " why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? " 
neg/cv926_18471.txt these were just some of my questions early on . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt later , i asked , " where's the magic of the first three films ? " 
neg/cv926_18471.txt and " why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
neg/cv926_18471.txt by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the phantom menace is no star wars film . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt it's an embarrassment . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt this is not what i wanted to see . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt not one thing . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt what was his life like before this film ? 
neg/cv926_18471.txt well , i imagine he didn't have one . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt that's why he feels like a plot device . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i've seen many movies that qualify as " special effects extravaganzas , " but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt and then there's the question of magic . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt and what about the ridiculous expectations ? 
neg/cv926_18471.txt mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt it's here to stay . 
neg/cv926_18471.txt i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don't , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . 


neg/cv663_14484.txt

neg/cv663_14484.txt what hath kevin williamson wrought ? 
neg/cv663_14484.txt while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt add to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt first , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt this sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer's look . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt dressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , 
neg/cv663_14484.txt sans the hook . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt one thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of " mythology " passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt it hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn't ) . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt michelle , slain by the " killer lurking in the backseat " of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt the setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there's also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ 
neg/cv663_14484.txt starlet jennifer love hewitt , but i'd talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt _dawson's_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt granted , the cast is hampered by their material . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt loretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive . 
neg/cv663_14484.txt if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims . 


neg/cv682_17947.txt

neg/cv682_17947.txt often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don't convert into a solid work . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt over time , the people have taken to themselves . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt so what happens when a " tourist " ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? 
neg/cv682_17947.txt he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this musician . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt technically , this film is a nightmare . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt the film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt there was , however , potential for this film . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt these are all topics that could easily fill a movie . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt perhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren't such a bore . 
neg/cv682_17947.txt until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out " mommy " while he wanders astray in a park .

neg/cv807_23024.txt and i thought " stigmata " would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt turns out i was wrong , because while " stigmata " was merely boring and self-important , " end of days " is completely inept on all fronts . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and " batman & robin " doesn't count ) is no fun at all . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt  " end of days " is a major stinker . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt he acts like one would expect the devil to act . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt byrne's speech about the bible being " overrated " actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the " 'tis not ! " 
neg/cv807_23024.txt variety ) are feeble at best . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
neg/cv807_23024.txt if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt it's convoluted and silly at the same time . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt  . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt  . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt how come he can't control jericho or christine ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in " end of days , " complete with the old " black cat hiding in a cabinet " bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a " boo " will come . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt their predictions will rarely be wrong . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt supposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , " wow , cool ! " 
neg/cv807_23024.txt  " end of days " is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt the devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt this doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in " end of days " goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt if violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt scenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt reasons ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt to hell with reasons ! 
neg/cv807_23024.txt let's just blow stuff up ! 
neg/cv807_23024.txt isn't it cool ? 
neg/cv807_23024.txt nope , not by a long shot . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt this film is thoroughly unwatchable . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt it's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt  " end of days " might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt if it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack . 
neg/cv807_23024.txt as it stands , " end of days " is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . 


neg/cv259_11827.txt

neg/cv259_11827.txt  " mercury rising " has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt that's right . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of " mercury rising . " 
neg/cv259_11827.txt i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt unlike dustin hoffman's performance in " rain man " or leonardo dicaprio's in " what's eating gilbert grape , " we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt however , unlike " rain man " which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , " mercury rising " could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt hell , he doesn't even have to be shy . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here " mercury rising " doesn't rise to the challenge . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including " sea of love " ( 1989 ) and " malice " ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt taken as a whole , " mercury rising " is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . 
neg/cv259_11827.txt maybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .

neg/cv556_16563.txt blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's " like water for chocolate " and 1991's " the butcher's wife , " " simply irresistible " attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . 's " buffy , the vampire slayer " ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a young woman who runs her late family's struggling new york restaurant , runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt while out shopping , she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery ) , a charming , handsome man , who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for , and later when he decides to drop by her dive , called southern cross , for lunch , she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him , even though she is known to not be a very good chef . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt suddenly , amanda finds her restaurant , on the edge of foreclosure , rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food , which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt are amanda and tom destined to be together ? 
neg/cv556_16563.txt and is it not just because of the magical food , but because they really , truly like each other ? 
neg/cv556_16563.txt and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ? 
neg/cv556_16563.txt does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ? 
neg/cv556_16563.txt  " simply irresistible " is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you've got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt the cast of " simply irresistible " is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt patricia clarkson ( 1998's " high art , " in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom's colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt also of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda's cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt of the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she's struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt the bottom line is that " simply irresistible " is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt when i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab . 
neg/cv556_16563.txt now , that certainly is what i'd call magical !

neg/cv370_5338.txt the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . 
neg/cv370_5338.txt spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films .

neg/cv370_5338.txt what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . 
neg/cv370_5338.txt director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . 
neg/cv370_5338.txt the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . 
neg/cv370_5338.txt as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . 
neg/cv370_5338.txt one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james
