neg/cv578_16825.txt its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt with the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt when he finds out about ``insectopia , " a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt about 15 minutes into the picture , i began to wonder what the point of the film was . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt halfway through , i still didn't have an answer . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt by the end credits , i just gave up and ran out . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone can't act , even in a cartoon . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt this film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull . 
neg/cv578_16825.txt hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in .

neg/cv397_28890.txt at the end of an action scene in " lara croft : tomb raider , " a wall collapses near the nubile warrior . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says " oh , my car keys ! " 
neg/cv397_28890.txt i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt based on an incredibly popular video game , " lara croft : tomb raider " is a lousy movie . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage " baywatch " fashion . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la " austin powers . " 
neg/cv397_28890.txt now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? 
neg/cv397_28890.txt of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? 
neg/cv397_28890.txt  " tomb raider " sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt intended to be a rousing " indiana jones " style adventure , " tomb raider " lacks any sense of tension . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt the low point comes when lara is " threatened " by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt  " tomb raider " tells a story , sort of . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) . 
neg/cv397_28890.txt none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of " lara croft : tomb raider " is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts .

neg/cv610_24153.txt and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt welcome to `ready to rumble' . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt `ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome' . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt by day , they transport raw sewage . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' 
neg/cv610_24153.txt they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt `rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt but the violence is too excessive . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? 
neg/cv610_24153.txt he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others ) . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt wcw fans are sure to appreciate these . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt others . . . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt well , won't . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt i found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt ahhh . . . . 
neg/cv610_24153.txt `praise' for the film : in `ready to rumble' , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette's `at&t' television commercials .

neg/cv049_21917.txt 1900 . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt you heard right . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt his name is , in all actuality , 1900 . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt 1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . "

neg/cv049_21917.txt one day , he discovers a grand piano . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt he sits down and starts playing . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt miraculously , what comes out is beautiful . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations " 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! " 
neg/cv049_21917.txt ho ho ho . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask .

neg/cv049_21917.txt max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !

neg/cv049_21917.txt ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery ! 
neg/cv049_21917.txt the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .

neg/cv049_21917.txt piano duel ? 
neg/cv049_21917.txt there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt 1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt ditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz " who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt this effort is utterly limp and lifeless . 
neg/cv049_21917.txt at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .

neg/cv636_16954.txt 200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this disappointed me greatly . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt at the bar , he runs into two more girls . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt kate hudson is a huge klutz . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt there is not much to say about the performances in the film . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from " i want candy " to " tainted love . " 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , " is there a reason to this ? 
neg/cv636_16954.txt is there any moral story ? 
neg/cv636_16954.txt is there a point ? 
neg/cv636_16954.txt are any of the events going on in the film necessary ? 
neg/cv636_16954.txt do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? " 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better . 
neg/cv636_16954.txt the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .

neg/cv246_28668.txt  " silverman " has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match .

neg/cv246_28668.txt thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the " brains " of the gang . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though . 
neg/cv246_28668.txt jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( " american pie " and " loser " ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has .

neg/cv608_24647.txt to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt worse , there's the promise of a sequel . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt why ? ! 
neg/cv608_24647.txt save your money . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt some films go quickly to video . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . ' 
neg/cv608_24647.txt in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . ' 
neg/cv608_24647.txt travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt `we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt `but first , we need a few more supplies . ' 
neg/cv608_24647.txt in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt and after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? 
neg/cv608_24647.txt at a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt in addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt this led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt but the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt if the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt like terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . 
neg/cv608_24647.txt could that be the scientology message ?

neg/cv516_12117.txt what are the warning signs of a * terrible * movie ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt making it's debut at the dollar theater ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt locally , chairman of the board did just that . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt having the annoying prop comic scott thompson ( better known as carrot top ) in the lead role ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt chairman of the board , once again . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt how about an overly exhausted , paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt did somebody say chairman of the board ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt that's right , carrot top's long dreaded major motion picture debut ( at least for a starring role ) is poking up in a handful of theaters across the country . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt chairman of the board stars the obnoxious , wannabe-zany king of redheaded standup comics as a lazy but creative , inventive but uneventful generation x- er named edison . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small , rented house , edison bounces from job to job , always squandering away the money on his eccentric ( to say the least ) inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt this has the crabby landlady , ms . krubavitch ( estelle harris , best known as george constanza's mother on " seinfeld " ) , threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren't furnished post haste . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt as luck would have it , edison soon meets armand mcmillan ( jack warden ) , an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multi-million dollar mcmillan industries . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt sharing a passion for more than just riding waves , armand is deeply impacted by the young inventor's notebook of dreams and ideas , and when the old man dies soon afterward , edison learns he is named a benefactor in armand's will . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt predictably , edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt predictably , there is a bitter nephew ( larry miller ) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt predictably , there is an attractive employee ( courtney thorne-smith ) whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt predictably , the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company it's most profitable and successful turnaround ever , all because he ran things by common sense and not greed . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt it's as though writers turi meyer , al septien , and alex zamm ( meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together ! ) 
neg/cv516_12117.txt pulled a plot out of a hat and worked carrot top into it . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt the jokes , the " surprises " , the developments - all of them run such a predictable path , it may only be carrot top's signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt a movie this bad speaks for itself . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt what's left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past ? 
neg/cv516_12117.txt the script is 100% recycled , the direction is hokey , and the acting is absolutely horrible . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt it is only thorne-smith who seems to take her job seriously , an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt she certainly went beyond the call of duty - she has to kiss carrot top ! ! ! ! ! ! 
neg/cv516_12117.txt  ( barf bag , please ! ) 
neg/cv516_12117.txt movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for " bad " there really are . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt chairman of the board , without a doubt , deserves each and every one . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt the only way this won't end up on everybody's " bottom ten of the year " list , is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it . 
neg/cv516_12117.txt just because you can't miss his outlandish fiery mane , don't skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature . 


neg/cv414_11161.txt

neg/cv414_11161.txt the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt this movie can't make up its mind . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? 
neg/cv414_11161.txt or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? 
neg/cv414_11161.txt either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just aren't the right tone for this film . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop . 
neg/cv414_11161.txt a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ? 
neg/cv414_11161.txt yes , it's put that bluntly ! 
neg/cv414_11161.txt just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame .

neg/cv298_24487.txt it's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h . macy ) . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt they're trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city's hero numero uno , hogs all the action . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the good captain has his own problems . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt because he's all but eliminated crime , amazing's endorsement deals are falling through . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one-time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt so , no one is left to save the day but our would-be superheroes , but their abilities are more " little league " than " justice league . " 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on " friends " ) . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt after a painful first strike , the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , who carries her dead father's skull in her bowling ball ; invisible boy ( kel mitchell ) , who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him ; the spleen ( paul reubens ) , who blows devastating winds from his rear ; and the sphinx ( wes studi ) , a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt  " mystery men " boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt in addition to those already mentioned , the credits include lena olin as frankenstein's evil shrink , comedian eddie izzard and the fugees' prakazrel michel as disco-themed thugs , singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons , artie lange ( from " mad tv " ) as another thug , claire forlani ( from " meet joe black " ) as a waitress mr . furious is pursuing , louise lasser ( from " mary hartman , mary hartman " ) as the blue raja's mother , and actor/magician ricky jay as capt . amazing's manager . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the cast includes four oscar-nominated actors ! 
neg/cv298_24487.txt when i saw the list of players early last year , i figured the result would be a can't-miss comedy . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt yet , i must report disappointment . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the script is probably the worst of 1999 . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt nearly every joke misfires . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt  ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he's wearing glasses . ) 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work . 
neg/cv298_24487.txt the cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run .
