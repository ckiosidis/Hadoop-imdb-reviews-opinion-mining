pos/cv982_21103.txt i rented this movie with very high hopes . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt first of all , the casting for this film is great . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt william h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a " colored " person and his friends , the " non-colored " ones . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt her character is the most ambitious . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt his character is very confusing and he is not very believable . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt the movie is very provocative . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt some films are not meant to be that long . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt pleasantville is one of those films . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt first , they are amazed by the implementation of color . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt then they want to have it . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt then they do not want to . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt some movies need a lot of time . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt length is everything in films . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt i went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt luckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . 
pos/cv982_21103.txt only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . 


pos/cv852_27523.txt

pos/cv852_27523.txt being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt after all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt shot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt it is absolutely breathtaking . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i've got to do a remake of this film ! " 
pos/cv852_27523.txt but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : " okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . " 
pos/cv852_27523.txt yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . 
pos/cv852_27523.txt but at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . 


pos/cv249_11640.txt

pos/cv249_11640.txt upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be " hellraiser meets the crow " . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing " the strangers " and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt sutherland played the role as a true veteran . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt the film flowed beautifully . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the " dark city " , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in " the usual suspects " . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt but if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of " 12 monkeys " or " the crow " without the boredom or depression . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as " 12 monkeys " was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt dark city simply puts " spawn " to shame . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt in fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an " akira " -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt so my initial predictions were wrong . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt this film is anything but the meloncholy of " hellraiser " parts one through five . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt i'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city 
pos/cv249_11640.txt it's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away . 
pos/cv249_11640.txt the best film i've seen all year , and easily one of the best i've ever seen 


pos/cv514_11187.txt

pos/cv514_11187.txt krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt however , he found . . . nothing . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . 
pos/cv514_11187.txt it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 


pos/cv549_21443.txt

pos/cv549_21443.txt to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt `8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt frank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt arquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt it's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt does `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? 
pos/cv549_21443.txt only occasionally . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt some of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt those expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt `bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt the exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt goodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt `bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . 
pos/cv549_21443.txt scorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . 


pos/cv925_8969.txt

pos/cv925_8969.txt contact is a film that tries to do several different things . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the two " sides " are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( " i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth " ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . 
pos/cv925_8969.txt and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . 


pos/cv318_10493.txt

pos/cv318_10493.txt only a year after the initial release of " scream , " the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel " scream 2 " has arrived in our theaters . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt the premise of " scream 2 " is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called " stab , " based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in " scream , " is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt the satire in " scream 2 " thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt everything from " friends " and " saved by the bell " to " showgirls " and " terminator 2 " is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any " wes carpenter " jokes this time . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from " scream " ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt understandably , " scream 2 " does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated " slasher film " director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt unfortunately , " scream 2 " occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt as for the question of whether or not " scream 2 " is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt  . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt  . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt well , it's hard to say . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt i gave the first " scream " 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt  " scream 2 " bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . 
pos/cv318_10493.txt i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . 


pos/cv530_16212.txt

pos/cv530_16212.txt james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt a veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt the book's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt each of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones' examination of world war ii on the american soldier . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt there's a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt but most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt malick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt the issues at stake are many and one . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt told from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( " c-for-charlie " ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt and want to win the war they do . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt in an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c-for-charlie's commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt he's an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt at the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt welsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt the thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it's nearly three hours long . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998's other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt but to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences . 
pos/cv530_16212.txt director malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie .

pos/cv547_16324.txt steve soderbergh's " sex , lies , and videotape , " which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt made on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , " sex , lies , and videotape , " it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's " out of sight " ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's " schizopolis " ) . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , " sex , lies , and videotape , " is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , " short cuts " ) . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the film has one fault , however . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt  " sex , lies , and videotape , " although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . 
pos/cv547_16324.txt soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . 


pos/cv346_18168.txt

pos/cv346_18168.txt ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became " confused " and were unable to perform the scene . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask " have anything to say sam ? " 
pos/cv346_18168.txt to me , that's not a good sign . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt well , compared to rob and bruce anyway . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's " gala " premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . 
pos/cv346_18168.txt all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining .
