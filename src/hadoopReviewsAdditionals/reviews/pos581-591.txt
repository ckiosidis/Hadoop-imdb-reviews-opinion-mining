pos/cv457_18453.txt warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt while i don't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt but , in a nutshell , it's a good film . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim 
pos/cv457_18453.txt never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt however , it can't be ignored . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt while the " first " star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the " improvements " in the special editions ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious " pod race " sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in " ben hur " ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn't mind doing again . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ? 
pos/cv457_18453.txt the film is pure fun from beginning to end . 
pos/cv457_18453.txt and isn't that what really matters ? 


pos/cv775_16237.txt

pos/cv775_16237.txt in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt after all , old ned won't miss it . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt bannen and kelly are a perfect pair . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt waking ned devine may even be seen as a " full monty " for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt it is light , but thought provoking and sweet . 
pos/cv775_16237.txt i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film . 


pos/cv539_20347.txt

pos/cv539_20347.txt tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt that's a shocking 100 times profit ! 
pos/cv539_20347.txt rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt tbwp is simply smart . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt simply amazing in that respect , i must say . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt talk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt you have to see it for yourself . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? 
pos/cv539_20347.txt or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? 
pos/cv539_20347.txt well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . 
pos/cv539_20347.txt no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! 


pos/cv438_8043.txt

pos/cv438_8043.txt  " seven " is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt it's a serial killer mystery , but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt someone is murdering people who are offenders of " the seven deadly sins . " 
pos/cv438_8043.txt a fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions . . . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the " good guys " which makes the unseen villain seem so vile . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt however , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn't get killed by the end ) . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt this is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the production design is superb , in the spirit of " batman " and " the crow , " this film embodies the gothic mood . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the killer's victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt let's just say it seems a little too " mystery movie , " or too convenient in other words . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt this is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt if anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt  " seven " is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man . 
pos/cv438_8043.txt john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of " scum . " 
pos/cv438_8043.txt but as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice . 


pos/cv291_26635.txt

pos/cv291_26635.txt reflecting on " bedazzled , " a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring " steve the copy guy " who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt  " dear god , " he prays . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt  " i would give anything to have that girl in my life . " 
pos/cv291_26635.txt guess who then shows up ? 
pos/cv291_26635.txt she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt  " seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . " 
pos/cv291_26635.txt there's even an escape clause . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt but when he makes sweeping statements such as " i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison " , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt given the mischievous nature of the devil , " bedazzled " has many amusing moments . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt he ably assumes various personas . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt it's clear that she's having a good time with it all . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt but that would be playing with fire . 
pos/cv291_26635.txt what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is .

pos/cv340_13287.txt  ? what exactly have they done wrong , other than perhaps offend the fashion police ?

pos/cv340_13287.txt  ? who exactly is a " great " singer ? 
pos/cv340_13287.txt judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls .

pos/cv340_13287.txt of course , the point in a movie like " spice world " isn't plot .

pos/cv565_29572.txt susan granger's review of " hearts in atlantis " ( castle rock/warner bros . ) 
pos/cv565_29572.txt timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of " stand by me " with the mystical power of " the green mile . " 
pos/cv565_29572.txt based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt he's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt knowing he's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt the only explanation is that he's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond . 
pos/cv565_29572.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " hearts in atlantis " is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis .

pos/cv995_21821.txt wow ! what a movie . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt yep that pretty much describes this movie . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt period .

pos/cv995_21821.txt to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt there isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt or why they don't . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt this was a surprise hit as was american beauty . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt 'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt it has something that no other movies playing now has . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . 
pos/cv995_21821.txt i highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed .

pos/cv430_17351.txt synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt to throw a curveball into the fray , billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper . 
pos/cv430_17351.txt definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish .

pos/cv666_18963.txt when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt when i saw the trailers , i was thinking " hmm . . . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt this isn't bad at all . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt this just might have potential . " 
pos/cv666_18963.txt when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt this film could be good . . . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt but will it be ? 
pos/cv666_18963.txt when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt  " it's not our kind , " he says . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but " that doesn't make him my son . " 
pos/cv666_18963.txt tarzan grows up , vowing to be " the best ape ever " , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt one day , a new animal shows up : humans . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt this is where jane comes into the picture . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i'm not gonna tell you , sorry . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt you're gonna have to see for yourself . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the casting is fairly good . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i take back my insult on driver . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt she also has a fiesty attitude ( " i'm gonna kill ya ! " 
pos/cv666_18963.txt she says , more than once ) . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting " shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah " . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt not that she was the only funny character in the film , though . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into " un-sanitary " water . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt  ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of " trashing the camp " from the film . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt oh , well . . . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt overall , i was enthralled with tarzan . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements . 
pos/cv666_18963.txt i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan .
