neg/cv586_8048.txt this is the worst movie i've seen since the " so bad i walked out on it " " jingle all the way " . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt it is crap through and through . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being " cousins " ) . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt there is no plot anywhere , and the " dialogue " is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt they set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt as mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt this is the same problem he had in " jingle all the way " , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in " batman & robin " . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard " acting " , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt given the " script " , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt the hockey team from hell ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that " batman & robin " showcases ) . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a " why is she even in the film " vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt that's all traditional comic book stuff . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt why is there a big switch clearly marked , " heat " in mr . freeze's lair ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ? 
neg/cv586_8048.txt i could go on and on . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt  " batman & robin " is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the " worst film of the year " by the time 1998 rolls along . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt note to warner bros . -- if you're going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt because it could actually get worse than this . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt what schumacher does not understand is that " comic book " doesn't automatically equal unbearable idiocy . 
neg/cv586_8048.txt the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy . 


neg/cv822_21545.txt

neg/cv822_21545.txt bats is this year's camp flick . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt as for the rest of us , well . . . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt why has he done this , you ask ? 
neg/cv822_21545.txt because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt what do they do ? 
neg/cv822_21545.txt do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? 
neg/cv822_21545.txt nope . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt all we know is that bats are attacking . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats ! " 
neg/cv822_21545.txt some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt playing such characters does not help actors' careers . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is " so bad it's good , " you could do worse than bats . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt it does have a tremendous amount of camp value . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt i'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it . 
neg/cv822_21545.txt more power to them . 


neg/cv688_7884.txt

neg/cv688_7884.txt capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i thought : it's about these two cops . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and they're buddies , sort of . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and the bad guy is a drug lord . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i only missed the bit about the badges . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt the rest i got dead-on . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and i hadn't even left the video store yet . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's " not getting any " , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's " back door man " . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt not funny ; tiresome . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and men in black . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt movies like this are not about originality . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i know this . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt they are about style and energy and synergy between actors . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i know this , too . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i could write this movie . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt you could write this movie . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt many people have . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt more the fools we all . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt the same could be said about this movie . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again . 
neg/cv688_7884.txt soon . 


neg/cv777_10247.txt

neg/cv777_10247.txt when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of " mr . magoo , " special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt in fact , they were wrong . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the worst , mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the first problem with mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo is the script . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo is comically barren . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but " top form " is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt most of mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt the screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn't seem to be enjoying themselves . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt mr . 
neg/cv777_10247.txt magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .

neg/cv671_5164.txt david schwimmer ( from the television series " friends " ) stars as a sensitive ( and slightly neurotic ) single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother ( barbara hershey ) of a classmate he can't remember . 
neg/cv671_5164.txt hello mrs . robinson ! 
neg/cv671_5164.txt though quite cute as a romantic comedy , the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march .

neg/cv646_16817.txt  " with all that education , you should know what happiness is . " 
neg/cv646_16817.txt starring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung 
neg/cv646_16817.txt every country has , eventually , its new wave . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt france had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt some waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it does not lack ambition . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt no one is happy . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt but it goes wrong . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt seen now , it does not seem provocative . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt at two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt consider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it's his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's leading cinematographers . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle's inexperience or yang's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . 
neg/cv646_16817.txt in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .

neg/cv040_8829.txt lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt great acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt the story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt she was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt don't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt maybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . 
neg/cv040_8829.txt other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film .

neg/cv465_23401.txt disconnect the phone line . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt don't accept the charges . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt `hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt this is an annoying and ineffective device . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt `georgia' . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt her frenzy is apparent . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt but really , it's no mystery . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt uh-uh . 
neg/cv465_23401.txt it's a wrong number from the beginning . 


neg/cv027_26270.txt

neg/cv027_26270.txt reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , " oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! " 
neg/cv027_26270.txt it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
neg/cv027_26270.txt auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's " style " , not the director's that winds up on screen . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar 
neg/cv027_26270.txt be damned ) . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt  " how did you know that ? " 
neg/cv027_26270.txt the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt  . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt  . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt their company's current logo could be " we ride the trends " . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) 
neg/cv027_26270.txt james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau 
neg/cv027_26270.txt  ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . 
neg/cv027_26270.txt these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .
