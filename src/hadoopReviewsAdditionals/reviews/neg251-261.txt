neg/cv902_13217.txt there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt  ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) 
neg/cv902_13217.txt it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt however , the film simply fails on that note . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt she's still making good money though . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt plot holes , plot holes , plot holes . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt now , e . l . e . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? 
neg/cv902_13217.txt where's the logic ? 
neg/cv902_13217.txt leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt now that is a more practical use for caves . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt what is the point of living in caves ? 
neg/cv902_13217.txt there is no , unlike `dr . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt how do plants grow ? 
neg/cv902_13217.txt if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it . 
neg/cv902_13217.txt okay ? 


neg/cv170_29808.txt

neg/cv170_29808.txt mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt something else is what he did . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt she wants to build a career as an actress . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt she does not know who the woman is . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt he just chooses not to . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt the film is a little long for the subject matter . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt mulholland drive spoiler warning . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt i have rated this film fairly low . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt david lynch is in large part a dark satirist . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) 
neg/cv170_29808.txt playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt the audience expectation is that they will add up . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt but he has given clues that are self-contradictory . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt mad magazine called it a poiuyt . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt look at small portions of it and makes sense . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt look at the whole figure and it does not . 
neg/cv170_29808.txt this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . 


neg/cv297_10104.txt

neg/cv297_10104.txt this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt they sacked him after he got sick . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt that actually is the whole storyline . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt speed 2 could do without dialogues . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt the movie is all about images and remarkable sound . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt i don't really know why this is called an action movie . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt then desaster strikes . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt i looked for the " action " but couldn't find it . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt most of the time she is part of the decoration . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt now we know that she can handle a chain saw . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt he doesn't succeed , though . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt but the ilm special effects can't save the movie . 
neg/cv297_10104.txt for all the money they could have done better . 


neg/cv130_18521.txt

neg/cv130_18521.txt i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt i've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt after all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth " 
neg/cv130_18521.txt then i saw cruel intentions . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt the very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt but it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt i'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt now you're probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? " 
neg/cv130_18521.txt the answer is no . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt it's actually much worse . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt and then pouring acid on the salt . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt i don't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom . 
neg/cv130_18521.txt from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don't remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits . 


neg/cv483_18103.txt

neg/cv483_18103.txt movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called " teenagers . " 
neg/cv483_18103.txt can't hardly wait , however , does not . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt i couldn't stand any of those characters . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming " yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! " , 
neg/cv483_18103.txt all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt and when i say " forced " , i mean it . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as " i am a sex machine . " 
neg/cv483_18103.txt for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny . 
neg/cv483_18103.txt if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .

neg/cv565_29403.txt alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure " the musketeer . " 
neg/cv565_29403.txt for some reason that i may figure out later , i don't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of " the musketeer . " 
neg/cv565_29403.txt it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film's xin-xin xiong ( " once upon a time in china " ) and yuen woo-ping from " crouching tiger , hidden dragon . " 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 " the three musketeers " ) , the man with no name from " a fistful of dollars " ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the " matrix " crowd . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the real problem with the " the musketeer " lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt if " the musketeer " makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in " the princess bride ) . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt it is all routine stuff . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt it works in a sci-fi film like " the matrix " or in a classical fantasy like " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " but just calls attention to itself in " the musketeer . " 
neg/cv565_29403.txt at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed . 
neg/cv565_29403.txt with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .

neg/cv186_2396.txt romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can't remember seeing a character quite like her . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt what a woman ! 
neg/cv186_2396.txt lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt there is little insight into her character . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt both women were anything but sexy or attractive . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt fine . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt fine . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt what does jack proceed to do ? 
neg/cv186_2396.txt he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt why ? 
neg/cv186_2396.txt the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt she proceeded to set the place on fire . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ? 
neg/cv186_2396.txt aren't dental records more important ? 
neg/cv186_2396.txt as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ? 
neg/cv186_2396.txt  ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) 
neg/cv186_2396.txt lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt this film doesn't even add up the large details . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt there is little or no consistency in the story-line . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt not much makes sense . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt so while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt there's plenty more to tear apart in this film . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt my advice to someone who hasn't seen it to to wait until it comes on video . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt it's not a boring film , just not a good one . 
neg/cv186_2396.txt or an intelligent one . 


neg/cv995_23113.txt

neg/cv995_23113.txt if anything , " stigmata " should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i suppose i should have seen this coming . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt after all , " blair witch " thoroughly creeped me out , " sixth sense " was mildly spooky , and then " stir of echoes " had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt is it then any surprise that " stigmata " is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt no , not really . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a " fifth gospel " before they were excommunicated . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the new rupert wainwright music video . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt  . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt  . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i mean film " stigmata " is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , " see ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt look at what i can do ! 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . " 
neg/cv995_23113.txt maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt arrrrrrrghhhh . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt  . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt  . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if " stigmata " had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt go clubbing ! 
neg/cv995_23113.txt sure , that makes sense . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , " i'll get you , my pretty , " for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt which one is it ? 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt  " stigmata's " religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as " stigmata " does . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt so much is overdone in " stigmata , " that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . 
neg/cv995_23113.txt the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and " stigmata " is it . 


neg/cv476_18402.txt

neg/cv476_18402.txt a backdrop of new year's eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt the decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt but despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with " 200 cigarettes . " 
neg/cv476_18402.txt a better title for this nostalgic mess would be " 50 missed opportunities . " 
neg/cv476_18402.txt what is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ? 
neg/cv476_18402.txt it's certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt there's courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in " the opposite of sex " ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about " good will hunting . " 
neg/cv476_18402.txt perhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ? 
neg/cv476_18402.txt maybe it looked good on paper . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt  " 200 cigarettes " is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york's festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt more subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick's cube . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt hudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt are we laughing yet ? 
neg/cv476_18402.txt the film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt game performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other . 
neg/cv476_18402.txt if this is " 200 cigarettes , " then get me 200 nicotine patches .

neg/cv055_8926.txt funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt  " get new jobs ! " 
neg/cv055_8926.txt was one line , if i remember correctly . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt give me a break . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . 
neg/cv055_8926.txt by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand .
