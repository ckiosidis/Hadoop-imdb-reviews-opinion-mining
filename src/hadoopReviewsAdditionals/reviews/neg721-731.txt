neg/cv454_21961.txt retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt a timeless epic it is not . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt even his fellow troopers are petrified . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt `the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt almost too 90's , it seems . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' 
neg/cv454_21961.txt sprinkled throughout the screenplay . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . 
neg/cv454_21961.txt despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .

neg/cv356_26170.txt the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : " quality " films ) compete for audiences . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of " uniqueness " betty dolls out is ? 
neg/cv356_26170.txt for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things " average " people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim " boys will be boys " . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! 
neg/cv356_26170.txt what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt it's the best work she's ever done . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt betty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt betty has an interesting theme , though it doesn't even seem aware of this . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . 
neg/cv356_26170.txt instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .

neg/cv074_7188.txt

neg/cv074_7188.txt for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt  ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) 
neg/cv074_7188.txt anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt how do we know this ? 
neg/cv074_7188.txt because his character is set up with the token wife and kids . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? 
neg/cv074_7188.txt and get kicked out of the house ? 
neg/cv074_7188.txt and get welcomed back anyway ? 
neg/cv074_7188.txt don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt don't ask . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt what's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? 
neg/cv074_7188.txt -- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . 
neg/cv074_7188.txt the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers .

neg/cv649_13947.txt plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who's planning a bank heist . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy's jazz club . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt they're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt meanwhile wendy's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues 
neg/cv649_13947.txt the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the " what the hell where they thinking " category that takes up 98% of the rest . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt which is unfortunately , the other main story isn't any great shakes either . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn't improve on repeated viewing . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt there is no doubt that this film's achilles heel is its script . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt as for the rest of the cast , it's a mixed bag . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt john flaus , one of australia's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn't given a whole lot to do . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt if only deborah parson's script could have supported this idea better . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt having two director's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn't pull away to anything else . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt it has no reason to it ; it's just bad direction . 
neg/cv649_13947.txt and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed . 


neg/cv773_20264.txt

neg/cv773_20264.txt i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt critique : " speed on an ice-cream truck " is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr . , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously " written " , that we just had to crack up . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it . . . 3 scenario ! 
neg/cv773_20264.txt and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters . . . . " elvis " 
neg/cv773_20264.txt and " nighshift " , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel ) . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr . got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project . 
neg/cv773_20264.txt did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ?

neg/cv765_20429.txt it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt what a crock . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt you're fired . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt let's get someone else to do it . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt - i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i miss originality in film , i really do . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a " bad guy " , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt this idea is completely stretched out . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt $70 , 000 is like spare change to them . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt maybe i'm being too hard on the movie . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt that's why we're allowed to root for him . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt but he's wrong here . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? 
neg/cv765_20429.txt really , i don't care . 
neg/cv765_20429.txt i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can .

neg/cv280_8651.txt capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt movie , where s . f . e . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt means so f * * * ing earnest . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt  ( ugh ! ) 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the problem with claire . . . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt why is it that any " serious " ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ? 
neg/cv280_8651.txt the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . 
neg/cv280_8651.txt what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants . 


neg/cv191_29539.txt

neg/cv191_29539.txt after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . " 
neg/cv191_29539.txt to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on " the roller coaster of superstardom . " 
neg/cv191_29539.txt in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt you'll figure it out . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt what a mistake . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt she actually looks scared during her one love scene . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , " oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . " 
neg/cv191_29539.txt everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt to say more would be a waste . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt there's so much wrong with this film . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get . 
neg/cv191_29539.txt but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . 


neg/cv864_3087.txt

neg/cv864_3087.txt i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt take the professional , for example . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . 
neg/cv864_3087.txt a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .
