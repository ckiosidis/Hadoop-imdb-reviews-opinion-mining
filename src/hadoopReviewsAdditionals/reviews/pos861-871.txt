pos/cv088_24113.txt the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' 
pos/cv088_24113.txt the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt she's a very bright person with a good heart . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt yet , her life is a miserable waste of time . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt to her , this made sense long ago . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt but now , it's a different story . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' 
pos/cv088_24113.txt and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? 
pos/cv088_24113.txt perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt however , his lack of commitment threatens their success . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt `where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt fiorentino is also a fun presence . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt you root for her despite her sense of amorality . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . 
pos/cv088_24113.txt with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . 


pos/cv770_10451.txt

pos/cv770_10451.txt ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt and fate has decreed that they will one day meet . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt  ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) 
pos/cv770_10451.txt yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt thematically , the film is also strong . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional " strip poker " where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt oscar does not see gambling as a vice . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford's paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen's persuasion ) as lucinda's close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar's mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt there's a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt  ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) 
pos/cv770_10451.txt with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . 
pos/cv770_10451.txt so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? 
pos/cv770_10451.txt oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . 


pos/cv174_9659.txt

pos/cv174_9659.txt no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! 
pos/cv174_9659.txt i can't stand this anymore ! ' . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . 
pos/cv174_9659.txt be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! 
pos/cv174_9659.txt event horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! 
pos/cv174_9659.txt it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . 


pos/cv092_28017.txt

pos/cv092_28017.txt a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . " 
pos/cv092_28017.txt dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . 
pos/cv092_28017.txt but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . 


pos/cv489_17906.txt

pos/cv489_17906.txt in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt payback is often a very violent film . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role . 
pos/cv489_17906.txt in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work .

pos/cv914_28742.txt susan granger's review of " legally blonde " ( m . g . m . ) 
pos/cv914_28742.txt it's a " pretty in pink " / " clueless " coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt the girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : " if i'm going to be a senator by the time i'm 30 . . . i 
pos/cv914_28742.txt need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . " 
pos/cv914_28742.txt determined to prove she's as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt once there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt in the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there's wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt first-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who's joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt the supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " legally blonde " is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . 
pos/cv914_28742.txt filled with ditzy blonde ambition , it's a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see . 


pos/cv419_13394.txt

pos/cv419_13394.txt the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? 
pos/cv419_13394.txt that's basically how i felt about this movie . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you 
pos/cv419_13394.txt know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in ) . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to " take care " of the problem . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband .

pos/cv419_13394.txt and here is where the fun begins . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt from this point on , it's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt and for the most part , they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body . 
pos/cv419_13394.txt but who cares ? 
pos/cv419_13394.txt if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie , you can't do much better than this .

pos/cv283_11055.txt trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt dave and gerald too have problems of their own . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout . 
pos/cv283_11055.txt while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in 
pos/cv283_11055.txt half the time . 


pos/cv661_2450.txt

pos/cv661_2450.txt tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : " literary . " 
pos/cv661_2450.txt what's eating gilbert grape ? 
pos/cv661_2450.txt is such a film . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt the same can be said of the character of gilbert . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , " i knew someone like that once . " 
pos/cv661_2450.txt gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , " we're not going anywhere , " but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . 
pos/cv661_2450.txt thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .
