neg/cv357_14710.txt what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ? 
neg/cv357_14710.txt you'd think you'd get the best of both films . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt instead you get woo . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt falling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt mayhem follows them . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt for some unknown reason ( read : contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo's antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt but for the sake of this bad movie ? 
neg/cv357_14710.txt sure , why not ? 
neg/cv357_14710.txt there are a few chuckles in the film , the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt in this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt a good joke , but a stolen one . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt woo won't be one either . 
neg/cv357_14710.txt so why was it made ? 
neg/cv357_14710.txt and more importantly , isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? 
neg/cv357_14710.txt everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point .

neg/cv783_14724.txt there isn't much good about this movie . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled " technicolor city " . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt john must find out who he is before the " strangers " ( a . k . a . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt any of these points however are completely " erased " from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true " b-movie " . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn't deserve to have the word " science " in science-fiction . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . 
neg/cv783_14724.txt lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable . 


neg/cv739_12179.txt

neg/cv739_12179.txt when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt toss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt this , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt for those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt the acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt grainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt quite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? 
neg/cv739_12179.txt another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt in retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt one , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt certainly she had to endure a miserable life . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt i felt trapped in the theater watching it . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt paulina runs 1 : 28 . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt the film is in spanish with english subtitles . 
neg/cv739_12179.txt it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 


neg/cv847_20855.txt

neg/cv847_20855.txt the previews for the movie are pretty good . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the residents of mystery love hockey . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes . ) 
neg/cv847_20855.txt every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt mystery's national fame has the town abuzz . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the mysterians see this as both good and bad . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt his " gift " of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt one character actually was interesting . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he says that what really matters in life is " community . . . . " 
neg/cv847_20855.txt then adds " and hockey . " 
neg/cv847_20855.txt i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt myers is a comic character actor . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt he's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself . 
neg/cv847_20855.txt it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously . 


neg/cv943_23547.txt

neg/cv943_23547.txt this movie stinks ! 
neg/cv943_23547.txt although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt i knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt this might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt or what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? 
neg/cv943_23547.txt now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt for example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt but instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt duh ! 
neg/cv943_23547.txt ultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt no , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt eventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt i will just mention one final flaw . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt the rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt he is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt does he phone the doctor ? 
neg/cv943_23547.txt no , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . 
neg/cv943_23547.txt you have been warned , stay away from this one . 


neg/cv883_27621.txt

neg/cv883_27621.txt plot : a down-and-out girl moves in with some over-the-top models and falls in love with a goofy-but-loveable guy from across the street . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt aaaaaaaaah ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt then one day , she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt ooooooooh ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt she must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable , or a psycho killer . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt aaaaaaaaah ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt critique : completely idiotic . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt okay , so maybe i'm being a little too nice . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt this movie starts off dumb , moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt there . . . that's 
neg/cv883_27621.txt more like it ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt and how , you may ask ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt well , it's simple really . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world ( oh my god , i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life . . . yipes ! ) 
neg/cv883_27621.txt join monica potter ( in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help ) and freddie prinze jr . ( not the actor , but the character better known as freddie prinze jr . ) , in a plot so stupid and far-fetched , that you have to wonder once more , how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt this thing stinks to high-heaven . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt it's just plain embarrassing for everyone involved . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called romantic-comedy-action movie ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt ugh . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt what a pile of dung . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt hey , i'm actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here , but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt it's sad really . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy , including the over-used " folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart " gag . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt pure hilarity ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt or maybe i'm just too jaded , too much of a critic , not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff-piece . . . uuuhhmmm . . . naaaaah ! ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt this movie sucks the big one . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt it's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because . . . well , 
neg/cv883_27621.txt it's supposed to be funny , see ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt you see , that person then has their legs swinging in the other person's face as they drive and that distracts the driver , see , and well , that's kinda funny , no ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt harumph . . . yeah , 
neg/cv883_27621.txt well . . . you 
neg/cv883_27621.txt get the picture ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt anyhoo , freddie prinze jr . . . . nuff 
neg/cv883_27621.txt said . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt monica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt the rest of the model girls . . . well , 
neg/cv883_27621.txt thanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt so why the three points out of ten , you may ask ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt well , it's simple really . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent ( don't ask me why , but it actually turned me on ) . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie ( nice window decoration . . . natch ! ) . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt and one last point goes out to the makers of this film , who spared us any long sorted story , and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage , so that we could run out as fast as we can , grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is . . . freddie prinze jr . . . i 
neg/cv883_27621.txt mean , head over heels . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt you've been warned , good people . 
neg/cv883_27621.txt ps : didja notice how i didn't even mention rear window once in my entire review ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt i didn't want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing , but then again , i just did mention it , but i guess it doesn't count in the ps section . . . or 
neg/cv883_27621.txt does it ? 
neg/cv883_27621.txt ooooh , whatever . . . i have a headache ! 
neg/cv883_27621.txt  ( i think my brain is coming back to life )

neg/cv804_11763.txt

neg/cv804_11763.txt for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt but these are the least of billy's problems . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . 
neg/cv804_11763.txt oldman got it about half right .

neg/cv536_27221.txt  * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ? 
neg/cv536_27221.txt attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt they become walking wardrobes . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream " shemp " ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt  ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) 
neg/cv536_27221.txt when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( " cabaret " ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt  ( aside : simon & garfunkel's " parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme " should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) 
neg/cv536_27221.txt heckerling has a lot in common with nora " you've got mail " ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt  ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) 
neg/cv536_27221.txt goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt  ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . ) 
neg/cv536_27221.txt not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't . 
neg/cv536_27221.txt that is her hallmark .

neg/cv020_9234.txt  " spawn " features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt in a classic example of telling and not showing , " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how " men are the ones who create evil on earth . " 
neg/cv020_9234.txt so much for a message . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt sweeney ) . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that " makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . " 
neg/cv020_9234.txt phew . got all that ? 
neg/cv020_9234.txt it would be easy to dismiss " spawn " as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt in movies like " contact , " the special effects serve the story . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt in " spawn , " they are the story . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt the film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt poor leguizamo . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt he starred in february's " the pest , " a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt the guy was brilliant in " to wong foo , thanks for everything ! 
neg/cv020_9234.txt julie newmar . " 
neg/cv020_9234.txt what is he doing wasting his talent in this and " the pest " ? 
neg/cv020_9234.txt i'm one of the few people that liked " batman & robin , " this summer's other big-budget comic book film . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of " batman " as the superior adaptation . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt there's a compelling story somewhere in " spawn " -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here . 
neg/cv020_9234.txt as it is , " spawn " is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . 


neg/cv283_11963.txt

neg/cv283_11963.txt a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed " mission from god " along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt as we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother's death in prison years ago . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt but elwood isn't completely without family . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt it seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt working as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother's affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt when bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt meanwhile , cab's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt >from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don't have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you'll be bored out of your skull . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd's self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt and seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . 
neg/cv283_11963.txt unfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .
