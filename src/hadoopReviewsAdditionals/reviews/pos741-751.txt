pos/cv546_11767.txt imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt so far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt there , trouble arises . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt not many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt as an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt contrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt after breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt the villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt the baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt worth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt alfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt breakdown yields exactly that . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . 
pos/cv546_11767.txt despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown .

pos/cv522_5583.txt

pos/cv522_5583.txt of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom 
pos/cv522_5583.txt the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt there's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt it's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt various mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt but if you think you've been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt the dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn't got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt whether it's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt the best thing is how these words aren't just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they're said in character , like tea leoni's neurotically-charged psychobabbler who's able to say under assault , " it's understandable if you find this threatening " . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt the cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt there are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt like allen , russell's interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt still , if you're expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la " murphy brown " / " frasier " / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won't happen . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt the film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character's search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster's charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt and that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . 
pos/cv522_5583.txt somehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . 


pos/cv135_11603.txt

pos/cv135_11603.txt as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt once again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . 
pos/cv135_11603.txt hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .

pos/cv062_23115.txt why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
pos/cv062_23115.txt too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt  " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt  " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt  " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . " 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt  " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . 
pos/cv062_23115.txt it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades . 


pos/cv722_7110.txt

pos/cv722_7110.txt  " a private matter " is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt after becoming pregnant ( for the fifth time ) she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt she and her husband decide , with the help of her doctor , to have an abortion . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt but this is the 1960s , and abortion is illegal . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law , by claiming that the child is endangering the mother's life . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt everything is about to work out just fine , until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt this sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt she and her husband are fired from their jobs , reporters are surrounding their home at all times , and most importantly , no one in the country ( and eventually other countries ) will perform the abortion . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt this causes emotion problems for all involved . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt  " a private matter " is a fascinating story and it's hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt it's only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell , and when sherri appropriately yells back , " just tell me what i'm supposed to do , " the woman has no answer . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt no one apparently had an answer , they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt this is an important film , telling an important story . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt it's not just about not wanting another child , it's about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family , none of which could be beneficial . 
pos/cv722_7110.txt sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie . 


pos/cv975_10981.txt

pos/cv975_10981.txt martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt but he simply uses the best tool for the job . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means " ocean of wisdom . " 
pos/cv975_10981.txt his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt  ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) 
pos/cv975_10981.txt we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt >from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt certain patterns take shape over the years . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt it just doesn't fit that mold . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . 
pos/cv975_10981.txt on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .

pos/cv108_15571.txt

pos/cv108_15571.txt it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .

pos/cv108_15571.txt a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .

pos/cv108_15571.txt together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film . 
pos/cv108_15571.txt its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .

pos/cv469_20630.txt  " . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . " 
pos/cv469_20630.txt - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the year is 1794 . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt it's a man . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt he is remembering his childhood and youth . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt standing on his mother's grave he says : " oh mother . . you 
pos/cv469_20630.txt did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i 
pos/cv469_20630.txt will stop this . . i 
pos/cv469_20630.txt promiss . . " 
pos/cv469_20630.txt after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the result was ugliness . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the creature has escaped . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt brannagh has more or less done that . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt another thing is characters and actors . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt he is capable of killing without regret . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt  " i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and 
pos/cv469_20630.txt then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and 
pos/cv469_20630.txt as i killed him , i saw your face . . " 
pos/cv469_20630.txt that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : " for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . " 
pos/cv469_20630.txt rarely has a cinematic interpretation of " the daemon " approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : " . . all 
pos/cv469_20630.txt i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by 
pos/cv469_20630.txt my hand . . " . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? 
pos/cv469_20630.txt to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? 
pos/cv469_20630.txt shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt following her example , branagh does the same . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt his film is a tragic saga about playing god . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt victor frankenstein is not an evil man . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt he wanted to change the world to the better . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film " dracula " . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt in comparison , i can say that " dracula " has visuals that even " frankenstein " can not live up to . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt but when it comes to story , characters and casting , " frankenstein " is stronger . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's " interview with the vampire " . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . 
pos/cv469_20630.txt branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel . 


pos/cv208_9020.txt

pos/cv208_9020.txt i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt in spawn , it was the " living room hell " conclusion at the end . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt and all of face/off was pretty dang good . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt okay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) 
pos/cv208_9020.txt few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt kind of weird , huh ? ) 
pos/cv208_9020.txt all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt sorry . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt my apologies to o'donnell fans . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt he decided not to sell them to me , because they were " innappropriate " . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt hmm . . . . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt good question . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i'll move on to the movie now . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . ) 
pos/cv208_9020.txt men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i'm not even really paying attention anymore . ) 
pos/cv208_9020.txt the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for " black humor " , directing both addams family movies . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt it's not bad , i gave it * * * . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point . 
pos/cv208_9020.txt i think .
