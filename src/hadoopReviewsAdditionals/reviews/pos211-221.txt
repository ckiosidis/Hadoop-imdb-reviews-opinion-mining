pos/cv583_29692.txt until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he's released and ben is hanged . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? 
pos/cv583_29692.txt what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? 
pos/cv583_29692.txt  ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . ) 
pos/cv583_29692.txt yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt powell's " love " and " hate " knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt he's like the senior class president with an evil streak . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt if i ever need to stay awake , i'll just picture him crooning , " leaning . . . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt leaning . . . . " 
pos/cv583_29692.txt any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt it's a testament to both men that they're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we're more scared by what we don't see . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt the only lapse is the movie's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt do yourself favor and don't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling . 
pos/cv583_29692.txt screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) . 


pos/cv015_29439.txt

pos/cv015_29439.txt plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt his entry and adaptation to the whole " rock 'n roll " lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt i was also impressed by some of the " real " musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt oh yeah , and for those who dig the " heavier " side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! 
pos/cv015_29439.txt you see . . . dreams 
pos/cv015_29439.txt can come true . . . 
pos/cv015_29439.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv015_29439.txt almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) 


pos/cv012_29576.txt

pos/cv012_29576.txt synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt review : a small but enchanting movie , " hearts in atlantis " easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , " stand by me " , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt  " hearts " is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt unlike " stand by me " , there is a supernatural element to " hearts " , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt like " stand by me " , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in " along came a spider " and who is simply radiant here as carol . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . 
pos/cv012_29576.txt but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .

pos/cv907_3541.txt notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica is a film that grows on retrospection . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica is very much worth seeing . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) 
pos/cv907_3541.txt what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? 
pos/cv907_3541.txt first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . 
pos/cv907_3541.txt a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . 


pos/cv203_17986.txt

pos/cv203_17986.txt he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way " his " boy has turned out . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt so far , so good . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he observes what it might be like . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt  . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt  . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt although de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt innocence triumphs . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . 
pos/cv203_17986.txt it's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies . 


pos/cv785_22600.txt

pos/cv785_22600.txt when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show " woody's round-up " except for a woody doll . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on " zurg's fortress " ( i . e . , al's apartment building ) . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the original " toy story " won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in " toy story " buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt  " toy story 2 " addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the other toys are shocked that woody has been " shelved , " and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt of course , in spite of the heavy themes " toy story 2 " explores , it's also very funny . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt most of the vocal performances are first-rate . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on " the simpsons " ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt the animation is even better than in the first . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt especially impressive were the textures of the figures . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt we can also see that bo peep is porcelain . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt as you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- " disney and pixar's 'toy story 2' " -- this is pixar's coming out party . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt they made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt on the downside , " toy story 2 " follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . 
pos/cv785_22600.txt overall , though , i had a great time and found " story 2 " to be a worthy successor to the first " toy story . " 
pos/cv785_22600.txt bottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! 


pos/cv898_14187.txt

pos/cv898_14187.txt a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of " simon birch , " the treatment is merely " suggested by , " rather than strictly based on , the book . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed " the world according to garp , " sold the rights to his novel " a prayer for owen meany " to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt  " a prayer for owen meany " is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , " like strangled mice . " 
pos/cv898_14187.txt simon believes himself to be " god's instrument , " placed on this earth to somehow effect god's plan . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for " simon birch " ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt watching " simon birch , " however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt fortunately , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bears his name . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( " jurassic park " ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt well , that would be telling . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt perhaps " suggested by " the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since " simon birch " only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon's extraordinary life . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt the film also changes the book's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon's lot . 
pos/cv898_14187.txt the flavor of irving's original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .

pos/cv577_28549.txt it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt on the technical side , shrek triumphs . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , " normal " beings . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt schulman . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . 
pos/cv577_28549.txt a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages .

pos/cv895_21022.txt the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )

pos/cv895_21022.txt our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt they are gates , new father sgt . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .

pos/cv895_21022.txt conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass-map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( it's great . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( a friend enthusiastically added , " it's like having sand in your eyes . " ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go ! " 
pos/cv895_21022.txt hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( it's not spoiling much to write that . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ? 
pos/cv895_21022.txt  ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . ) 
pos/cv895_21022.txt russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared . 
pos/cv895_21022.txt if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .

pos/cv359_6647.txt you don't want to be like mike . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt mike has been doing badly . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt embarrassingly bad . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt he broke up a six-year relationship six months ago to move from n . y . to l . a . and he's still not over her . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt as a result , his jokes fall flat when he tries to impress , and he's a comedian . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt well , an unemployed comedian , one of hollywood's little fish , and it has gotten so bad he's asked for an application at starbuck's . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt actually , the starbuck's thing gets even worse . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt and worse . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt you won't fail to like mike , however , played endearingly by jon favreau . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt swingers revolves around mike's half-hearted and awkward efforts to get back in the social swing of things . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends , such as trent ( vince vaughn with the film's most animated performance ) , who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking , gun-toting sue ( patrick van horn ) , and rob ( ron livingston ) , who once played hamlet but now longs to work as goofy in disneyland , but doesn't succeed because of his lack of " theme park experience . " 
pos/cv359_6647.txt together they talk about women - how to make eye contact , which involves avoiding it , and when to call so as never to appear desperate , two days being " industry standard . " 
pos/cv359_6647.txt after talking the talk , they walk the walk , strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be , always to laughable effect . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt to get mike out of his funk , his friends persistently convince him to get outside , whether it be to a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement " honey " and then keep vigil over his progress , or lack of it . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt like dotty doting parents , mike never leaves their company without being the recipient of their confidence cheerleading ( " you're money , mike , and the honeys know it .

pos/cv359_6647.txt with the unwavering support of friends like these , maybe mike's not doing too badly after all . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt favreau also doubled as the film's screenwriter , and he proves he has the gift for creating engaging characters and witty banter that goes beyond today's bon mot . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships , even when it hits its low points and the friends commiserate . 
pos/cv359_6647.txt when mike gets the gumption to look for love , you will join his cheerleading section as well .
