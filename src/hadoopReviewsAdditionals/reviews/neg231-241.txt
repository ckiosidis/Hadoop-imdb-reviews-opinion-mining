neg/cv537_13516.txt fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt and what's more , this beast is heading for new york . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt gulp ! 
neg/cv537_13516.txt although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt but what about the script ? 
neg/cv537_13516.txt well , that's not up to par either . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , 
neg/cv537_13516.txt broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) 
neg/cv537_13516.txt also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt  ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! 
neg/cv537_13516.txt ha ha ha ha ! . ) 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt velicorapters ) running around new york . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt right , so the script and acting suck . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt but what about the special effects ? 
neg/cv537_13516.txt thankfully , they're are quite good . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . 
neg/cv537_13516.txt let's just hope one never arrives . 


neg/cv549_22771.txt

neg/cv549_22771.txt cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i'll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt the film is based on a " mostly " true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt it's during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt for robbin's it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt let me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it's the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt i'll begin with those involved with the play . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt outside the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt there's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt anyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt now although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt sure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt the whole film is like this , and it's basically nothing but a headache . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt on the brighter side , tim robbin's direction was masterful . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson's latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can't make a movie that much better . 
neg/cv549_22771.txt although it has it's moments ( not many of them , but they're there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it's title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . 


neg/cv945_13012.txt

neg/cv945_13012.txt perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with " . . . this is the fake news , " norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt his shtick was marked by crassness . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt in this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , " maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex . " 
neg/cv945_13012.txt this kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt  " dirty work " , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt emotionally , they've never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt although having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt mitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt their idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they'll do your dirty work . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt in the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt their presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt by default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt except for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt already weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt but what's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying " note to self " ( " note to self : learn to fight , " he says after getting beat up ; " note to self : there's always beer , " he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we're just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt much like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits . 
neg/cv945_13012.txt the rest of the story is just dead space .

neg/cv327_21743.txt `the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? 
neg/cv327_21743.txt perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the problem is that his proposal sucks . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt big time . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt and within a very limited time frame . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt another is the colorful cast . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt yes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt `the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ? 
neg/cv327_21743.txt o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? ' 
neg/cv327_21743.txt in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . 
neg/cv327_21743.txt o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge .

neg/cv217_28707.txt the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into " heartbreakers . " 
neg/cv217_28707.txt ray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , " just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! " 
neg/cv217_28707.txt i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , " geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? " 
neg/cv217_28707.txt over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind " heartbreakers " predated " three's company . " 
neg/cv217_28707.txt suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about " booze and broads " and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the adults laughed and laughed . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt  " heartbreakers " reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt if so , they were sadly mistaken . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the " horrified " bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt their mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt as if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior " a fish called wanda . " 
neg/cv217_28707.txt i won't bother to compare the two . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt suffice to say that everything done right in " wanda " is done wrong here . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt  " heartbreakers " is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt bear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt if you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea . 
neg/cv217_28707.txt as for me , i'm going to watch " a fish called wanda " now and try to forget i ever saw " heartbreakers . " 


neg/cv606_17672.txt

neg/cv606_17672.txt filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt  ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) 
neg/cv606_17672.txt the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . 
neg/cv606_17672.txt  ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) 
neg/cv606_17672.txt at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

neg/cv848_10061.txt not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen .

neg/cv890_3515.txt all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt welcome to the club , scott kalvert . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . 
neg/cv890_3515.txt far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .

neg/cv934_20426.txt ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt the review 
neg/cv934_20426.txt jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says " been there , done that . " 
neg/cv934_20426.txt no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt universal soldier : the return is truly poor . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she " isn't leaving without her story " . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt whatever . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt when fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt i'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt he cringes , looks down and mutters " uh . . . uhm . . . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt eh he he he " the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like " i really don't like that guy " every time he fails to kill luc . 
neg/cv934_20426.txt sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video .
