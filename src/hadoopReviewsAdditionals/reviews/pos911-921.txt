pos/cv591_23640.txt the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as " i'll be right back , " or simply with the overall tone of the scene . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change ? 
pos/cv591_23640.txt that's the kind of bursting originality that allows " final destination " to invade the viewer's mind , even days after seeing it , making one pause before ever entering a dark room , taking a shower , or even going to sleep . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's " scream . " 
pos/cv591_23640.txt  " final destination , " directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick , glen morgan , and james wong , the latter two being writers for the t . v . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt series " the x-files , " is a movie with wonderful ideas , and executes them effortlessly . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt it's rare a film of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days , as the genre has seem to be completely worn out ? ? `but " final destination " has more in store for one than one can imagine . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt unlike " halloween " 's michael myers or " nightmare on elm street " 's freddy kruger , " final destination " 's killer is of the supernatural , the dark one himself , death . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the intriguing premise is as follows ; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt after boarding the plane , one of the students , alex browning ( devon sawa ) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff , killing everyone on board . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt once waking up , alex gets himself and six others off of that plane , all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt shortly after their departure , the plane takes off , and guess what ; it blows up in middair . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms . valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane ? ? `but who is next , and how will death get them ? 
pos/cv591_23640.txt  " final destination " is a film that is unbearably suspenseful ; always making the viewer frantic , as death will strike in the most unlikely of times . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt john denver's " rocky mountain high " being played pretty much warrants another death ? ? `everyone on that plane learned the hard way . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt although it's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you don't know when death is coming . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air ? ? ` and yes , the film is that intense . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par ; the best ensemble in this genre since " scream . " 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film , and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances , that , like the " scream " movies did for their cast , will launch them into superstardom . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive , although the two don't posses as much screen time as the leads . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt  " final destination " is one exhilarating , exciting ride . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film , and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt for the blood loving moviegoer , " destination " contains buckets of blood , guts , and all that good stuff . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt  " final destination " is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans , and a sleeper hit at the box office . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me . 
pos/cv591_23640.txt by scare , i don't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ? 
pos/cv591_23640.txt the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .

pos/cv534_14083.txt the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th/1998 ) 
pos/cv534_14083.txt starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert 
pos/cv534_14083.txt in " the heartbreak kid " , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt halfway there , he begins to resent his bride . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt the phrase " the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence " was practically written with him in mind . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt the end of " the heartbreak kid " is both hilarious and sad for that very reason . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt  " the heartbreak kid " was written by neil simon and it shows . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt the character of george costanza on " seinfeld " seems to have been modelled after him . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt  " the heartbreak kid " is not a date movie . 
pos/cv534_14083.txt it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend/boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health . 


pos/cv916_15467.txt

pos/cv916_15467.txt martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the performances are absolutely breathtaking . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . 
pos/cv916_15467.txt a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . 


pos/cv824_8838.txt

pos/cv824_8838.txt in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt other than these , the film is exactly the same . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? 
pos/cv824_8838.txt simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt the plot is basic but in the same way , complex . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt the film is obviously quite star-studded . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? 
pos/cv824_8838.txt it just happened to work out for him . 
pos/cv824_8838.txt the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever .

pos/cv399_2877.txt the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt hank's reaction is one of amusement . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt carly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt arguments ensue . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the family becomes even more alienated . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt one daughter says , " he's blind and she's crazy . " 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the other answers , " they're perfect for each other . " 
pos/cv399_2877.txt it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress ) . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he confronts the c . o . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt but not about carly . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt hank is arrested . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the performances are solid throughout . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he comforts her and offers protection . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt he had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years . 
pos/cv399_2877.txt the film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone . 


pos/cv010_29198.txt

pos/cv010_29198.txt after watching " rat race " last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt  " rat race " is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt then comes the setup . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , " today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . " 
pos/cv010_29198.txt the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt director jerry zucker ( " airplane , " " ghost " ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? " 
pos/cv010_29198.txt but enough carping . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt  " rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . 
pos/cv010_29198.txt see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . 


pos/cv892_17576.txt

pos/cv892_17576.txt perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . 
pos/cv892_17576.txt the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .

pos/cv171_13537.txt it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
pos/cv171_13537.txt i needn+t have worried . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt +mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt the plot is typical . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt he becomes one of the great comic villains . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt would the geek get the girl ? 
pos/cv171_13537.txt puh-lease . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt not everything works . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt there+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt and there are long stretches without much going on . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt but the wait is worth it . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt belly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt the farrelly brothers have finally done it . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt while tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt while raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt after the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . 
pos/cv171_13537.txt approach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . 


pos/cv802_28664.txt

pos/cv802_28664.txt the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's " odyssey " as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in " o brother , where art thou ? " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt right for the beginning of " o brother " the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in " raising arizona " ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in " miller's crossing " ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in " fargo . " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt in all cases , and in " o brother , " too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , " i am a man of constant sorrow . " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of " o brother . " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of " the wizard of oz . " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt they don't say " lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt while clooney is the name draw for " o brother , " the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt john goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george " babyface " nelson . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt the high points outweigh the low through most of " o brother , where art thou ? " 
pos/cv802_28664.txt with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music . 
pos/cv802_28664.txt i give it a b .

pos/cv384_17140.txt i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt this stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt rosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt herman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt it maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well . 
pos/cv384_17140.txt i hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .
