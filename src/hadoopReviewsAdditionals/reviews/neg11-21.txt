neg/cv399_28593.txt you'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt it hasn't worked so far . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  " street fighter ? " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  " super mario brothers ? " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  " wing commander ? " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  " mortal kombat ? " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt not a watchable film in the bunch . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt still i held out some hope for " tomb raider . " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt after all , the game's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt however , despite the potential of the project , " tomb raider " proves to be yet another bomb . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt there's a once-ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt however , the action in " tomb raider " shows little style or originality . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt there's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin' , but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct-to-cable flick . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer , " the mummy returns , " was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large-scale . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt since winning her academy award for " girl , interrupted , " jolie hasn't taken any projects that would display her acting talents . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  " tomb raider " seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts ; so much attention is drawn to them that it's a shame there's no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt while we don't see much of her acting ability ( with the exception of a wonderful upper-crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie's less savory side . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her ) seems a poor choice . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt having jolie's real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt i haven't decided what to make of director simon west yet . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt his first feature was the star-studded disaster " con air , " but my opinion of him improved with " the general's daughter , " which was thick with sultry atmosphere . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt now this train wreck . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series " the prisoner . " 
neg/cv399_28593.txt hollywood has already screwed up " the avengers , " and " the prisoner " represents a chance for redemption . 
neg/cv399_28593.txt  ( by the way , speaking of british tv , " red dwarf " fans should look for chris " rimmer " barrie in his first major film role ) .

neg/cv171_15164.txt starring : jennifer tilly , voice of brad dourif , katherine heigl , nick stabile , john ritter 
neg/cv171_15164.txt synopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt basically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt in bride of chucky , chucky's longtime girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half . 
neg/cv171_15164.txt the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic .

neg/cv570_28960.txt on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt the plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town .

neg/cv570_28960.txt it's not explained how he happens to be chinese . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt it sells sex to its patrons , and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place , as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film's staple . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt i'll take a pass on this one , it's just not my style of a film . 
neg/cv570_28960.txt the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget .

neg/cv452_5179.txt a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to " invent " a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " ( damon wayans ) . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt  ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . ) 
neg/cv452_5179.txt he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn't give us a reason to care . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt as a commentary on race relations , it's even * less * effective . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs ! " 
neg/cv452_5179.txt writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt the script isn't strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) . 
neg/cv452_5179.txt he comes across as absolute overkill .

neg/cv352_5414.txt can you say " dated " ? 
neg/cv352_5414.txt you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt  " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt it all seems so harmless in the beginning . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt  ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . )

neg/cv352_5414.txt when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .

neg/cv352_5414.txt and everyone's helping with the pregnancy .

neg/cv352_5414.txt years . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .

neg/cv352_5414.txt that's when you know your health's failing . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way . 
neg/cv352_5414.txt rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .

neg/cv067_21192.txt  " first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . " 
neg/cv067_21192.txt this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt this just goes to show that hype kills . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt it's very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt the story goes like this . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt how do they come up with this stuff ? 
neg/cv067_21192.txt anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt fincher shows us that society is like robots . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt call me crazy , but this is common knowledge . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt it just shows how desperate the script is for attention . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt helena bonham carter however really had no purpose . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt this continues for what seems like 6 hours . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . 
neg/cv067_21192.txt you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " this is so f * * * ing stupid . "

neg/cv485_26879.txt tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising " filth " like pulp fiction . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt 12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the " movement " which has apparently begun to grow . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't " gutsy " enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being " saved " , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt pay it forward offers " crowd pleasing " elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking " black hoodlum with a heart of gold " ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a " nigga " and says things like " can you feel me ? " 
neg/cv485_26879.txt leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt  ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all ) . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : " boy this outta floor em " . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt but oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt they're so adorable . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it's a movie that treats earth's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : " see my movie isn't as na ? ve as you might think " she seems to be saying . 
neg/cv485_26879.txt no , it's just horribly confused .

neg/cv009_29417.txt plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth , oops . . . i 
neg/cv009_29417.txt mean , an evil man . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt anyway , fourteen years go by and . . . arrgh , well , you know the rest . . . swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt critique : this is a pretty bad movie . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt let's see , where should i start ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt okay , what's next ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt acting , you say . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt now i'm not sure if this was ms . suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible " bad guy " , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before . . . a 
neg/cv009_29417.txt thousand times . . . by the same guy ! ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt tim , please . . . for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day " american roles " for you as a " nice guy " in a romantic comedy or something . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt stretch , dude . . . stretch ! ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt we all know that you can do much better than this gunk . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt alright , what else was bad in this film ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt oh yeah , the score ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a " real epic " by any stretch of the imagination . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some " shrewd " studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole " kung-fu " phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt dudes . . . you 
neg/cv009_29417.txt failed all around ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt  ( keep reading ) 
neg/cv009_29417.txt the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt  ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt why doesn't anybody look a day older , when the sequence says " 14 years later " ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt  ( at least . . . change 
neg/cv009_29417.txt your shirt , man ! ) 
neg/cv009_29417.txt keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a " fun time " , but this flick just didn't cut it for me . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt it was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the " romantic " scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its " raison-d'etre " , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt the first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt hullo ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt deneuve is barely in this movie ! 
neg/cv009_29417.txt ugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt now say it together , gang : " all for one , and one for all . . . we 
neg/cv009_29417.txt vow to stay away from it all ! ! " 
neg/cv009_29417.txt thank me later . 
neg/cv009_29417.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
neg/cv009_29417.txt a knight's tale ( 7/10 ) - american outlaws ( 5/10 ) - crouching tiger , hidden dragon ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the replacement killers ( 6/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )
