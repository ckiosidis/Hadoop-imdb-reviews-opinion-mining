neg/cv301_13010.txt carry on at your convenience is all about the goings-on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer , wc boggs ( kenneth williams ) . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model , the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner ( kenneth cope ) and friend bernie hulke ( bernard bresslaw ) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt meanwhile , chief foreman sid plummer ( sid james ) is growing tired of his wife beattie ( hattie jacques ) and her budgie . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races , he is over the moon and flush with money . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt his daughter , myrtle plummer ( jacki piper ) , is going out with wc's son lewis boggs ( richard o'callaghan ) and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt in the end , if the strike does not cease , boggs will have to close down his factory , but the support of a group of women led by coote's wife-to-be and spanner's mother , agatha spanner ( renee houston ) , try to resolve the situation . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt also , sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt there are some good performances , as usual , from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt his part is mildly amusing . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt richard o'callaghan is appealing as bogg's stuck-up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg's assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt however , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt in his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt joan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt sims' 'usual' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt additionally , bill maynard as fred moore is very poor . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt however , the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt this movie does not know where it is going . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for 'bluer' jokes or to maintain the 'innocent' jokes success of most of its predecessors . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt that is why this film suffers . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques . 
neg/cv301_13010.txt the new 'minor-regulars' such as o'callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while .

neg/cv432_15873.txt robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt just when it couldn't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . ) 
neg/cv432_15873.txt annie can't take the grief anymore , and kills herself . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt  ( all sounding like good fun so far ? ) 
neg/cv432_15873.txt the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . ) 
neg/cv432_15873.txt based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt there's no emotion behind it . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt she may look pretty , but she can't act . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt max von sydow is o . k as the traveller , if nothing special . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt while films like e . t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt instead , it's all rather boring . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there's something lacking . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt the script doesn't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ? s , and dud speeches . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt but there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss . 
neg/cv432_15873.txt better luck next time , robin .

neg/cv583_29465.txt susan granger's review of " two can play that game " ( screen gems ) 
neg/cv583_29465.txt since the success of " waiting to exhale , " there have been several romantic comedies about african-american professionals . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt this female revenge fantasy , vivica a . fox plays shante smith , a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success : a mansion , a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky , hot-shot lawyer , morris chestnut . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt she's at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl-friends ( mo'nique , wendy racquel robinson , tamala jones ) .

neg/cv583_29465.txt unfortunately , writer/director mark brown ( " how to be a player " ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who doesn't realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the " day one , " " day two " title-card device underscores the tedium . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut's boisterous best-friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who's given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt but the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " two can play that game " is smarmy if slick 4 , filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca-cola , miller genuine draft ) but little else . 
neg/cv583_29465.txt in this r-rated ( for explicit sexual language ) , pseudo-hip battle of the sexes , the audience loses .

neg/cv767_15673.txt everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . 
neg/cv767_15673.txt but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure . 
neg/cv767_15673.txt i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co .

neg/cv724_15265.txt

neg/cv724_15265.txt  " soldier " , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt then it goes nowhere with that idea . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt his performance in that way isn't all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt but enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? 
neg/cv724_15265.txt isn't the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? 
neg/cv724_15265.txt even in this aspect the film is a disappointment . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt in mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt however , he fails to repeat that in this film . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt the combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film . 
neg/cv724_15265.txt however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . 


neg/cv364_14254.txt

neg/cv364_14254.txt dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 
neg/cv364_14254.txt regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt you have to see it and experience it for yourself . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 
neg/cv364_14254.txt in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt but what a strange mess it is . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt can this be the same man ? 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt why ? 
neg/cv364_14254.txt who knows . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt what are the implications of this ? 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i have no idea . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt oh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . 
neg/cv364_14254.txt it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .

neg/cv083_25491.txt i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt sherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt people will be lined up around the block for it . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . 
neg/cv083_25491.txt i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .

neg/cv710_23745.txt after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt mission to mars takes it's first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt it's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt it's the year 2020 and this is nasa's first manned excursion to the red planet . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell ) . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the crew didn't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt  ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew's mission and life is in mortal danger . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character's personality trait . ) 
neg/cv710_23745.txt by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt there is an adage in film to " show , don't tell . " 
neg/cv710_23745.txt mission to mars does both . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt repeatedly . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the film's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the best i could come up with is pre-teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film's components would have been old hat even for them . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b-movie . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material . 
neg/cv710_23745.txt i felt no such earnestness .

neg/cv174_9735.txt starship troopers is a bad movie . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt i mean , a really , really , bad movie . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt as our faster than light travelling " heroes " arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt  " what ? " 
neg/cv174_9735.txt you say , " laser beam weapons ? 
neg/cv174_9735.txt sonic weapons ? 
neg/cv174_9735.txt phasers ? 
neg/cv174_9735.txt photon cannons ? " . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons ! 
neg/cv174_9735.txt i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons ! 
neg/cv174_9735.txt in the end , we see neil patrick " doogie howser " harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared ! 
neg/cv174_9735.txt this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) . 
neg/cv174_9735.txt i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .
