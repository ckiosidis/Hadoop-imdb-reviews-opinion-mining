pos/cv000_29590.txt films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? 
pos/cv000_29590.txt the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt the film , however , is all good . 
pos/cv000_29590.txt 2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content 


pos/cv865_2895.txt

pos/cv865_2895.txt every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a " sensation " at court . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . 
pos/cv865_2895.txt it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . 


pos/cv330_29809.txt

pos/cv330_29809.txt one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt his american buffalo is a set-bound piece that has very little plot . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt sometimes he will tell a story that really moves . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double-crossing the viewer . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt watching the film's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either " what the heck are they doing ? " 
pos/cv330_29809.txt or " why didn't anybody think of that before ? " 
pos/cv330_29809.txt appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt this is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt now joe has to get out of the business . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it was coming time anyway . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt joe's team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) , fran moor ( rebecca pidgeon ) , and pinky pincus ( ricky jay ) is going to split up and go separate ways . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt but crime boss bergman ( danny devito ) is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt and he has to take along a young kid , the short- fused jimmy silk ( sam rockwell ) . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt much of what distinguishes heist is mamet's dialog . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt remarkably it serves a double purpose . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet's special feel for dialog . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt hackman has lines like " everybody needs money . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt that's why they call it money . " 
pos/cv330_29809.txt mamet's timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score , which is , in fact , a very similar story . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt both are good films , perhaps for some of the same reasons . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt but at least on a high level they are much the same story . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 , 2001 . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt that made the subject matter just a little too timely . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt my understanding is that the release will be delayed . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon's acting at times seems very poor . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection , as if they are just reading the words for the first time . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller . 
pos/cv330_29809.txt it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


pos/cv603_17694.txt

pos/cv603_17694.txt in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt did it live up to the first film ? 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the answer is no . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt she has been so upset since the incident . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt it starts off as the weekend of their dreams . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
pos/cv603_17694.txt jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt let's start with settle . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt matthew is completely fake in this film . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt jennifer love hewitt's song , " how do i deal " is also played for about thirty seconds . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt he made them suffer for what they did . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense . 
pos/cv603_17694.txt the bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand . 


pos/cv350_20670.txt

pos/cv350_20670.txt synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt everyone else around him has similar symptoms . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ? 
pos/cv350_20670.txt opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is . 
pos/cv350_20670.txt if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty . 


pos/cv669_22995.txt

pos/cv669_22995.txt the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt will bowfinger be able to make his film ? 
pos/cv669_22995.txt or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? 
pos/cv669_22995.txt bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . 
pos/cv669_22995.txt if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . 


pos/cv922_10073.txt

pos/cv922_10073.txt if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt his life seems to be on the rise . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt is it all just a big nightmare ? 
pos/cv922_10073.txt or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
pos/cv922_10073.txt if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt it was at this point that i felt cheated . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt everything occurs from his perspective . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt it earned its r rating for a reason . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the story actually has something to say about humanity . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i have never seen him more believable to date . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt al pacino is of course the scene stealer . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt one familiar face with a twist was " coach " star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . 
pos/cv922_10073.txt personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . 


pos/cv783_13227.txt

pos/cv783_13227.txt cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt  ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt they are likely to be remembered for . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt  . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt  . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt well , quite a while . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i like this film , too . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? 
pos/cv783_13227.txt in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt yes , you read that right . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
pos/cv783_13227.txt if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt so , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt  ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) 
pos/cv783_13227.txt their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt  ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt a . j . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt i'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . 
pos/cv783_13227.txt what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . 


pos/cv896_16071.txt

pos/cv896_16071.txt bill condon's " gods and monsters " is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . " 
pos/cv896_16071.txt since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , " a dirty old man . " 
pos/cv896_16071.txt in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt clayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt  " gods and monsters " is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a " motion picture director , " rather than a " horror director . " 
pos/cv896_16071.txt and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt in lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt  " gods and monsters " is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt walking away from " gods and monsters , " it was ian mckellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . 
pos/cv896_16071.txt it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else's business in the first place . 


pos/cv155_7308.txt

pos/cv155_7308.txt the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt this prison , run by the v . c . , 
pos/cv155_7308.txt initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . 
pos/cv155_7308.txt the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette .
