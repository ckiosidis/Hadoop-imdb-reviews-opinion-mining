neg/cv342_20917.txt adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt it's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt but i digress . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she's leaving him . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn't the real father and wants to take julian back . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt big daddy really isn't that good . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt there's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt it's a poor attempt to win over the audience . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . ) 
neg/cv342_20917.txt joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt the two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt big daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt although it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash . 
neg/cv342_20917.txt big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that's about it . 


neg/cv093_15606.txt

neg/cv093_15606.txt numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . 
neg/cv093_15606.txt although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . 


neg/cv675_22871.txt

neg/cv675_22871.txt have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? 
neg/cv675_22871.txt well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the law firm's employees get a good chuckle . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the audience gets a good chuckle . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt there is something compelling about this mysterious woman . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt but he does not alert the authorities . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt peculiar . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt how bad is this movie ? 
neg/cv675_22871.txt i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . ' 
neg/cv675_22871.txt no doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt the major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt completely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . 
neg/cv675_22871.txt beyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . 


neg/cv526_12868.txt

neg/cv526_12868.txt let's get this one over with as quickly as possible . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt but as it is , " godzilla " is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch " last year at merienbad " until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt dracula ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt  " godzilla " opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word " gojira " ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt we are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt he is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the military , with dr . tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt everything about " godzilla " reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years " razzie " award . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt no . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the film is bleak and ugly looking . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt everything is ugly and dark . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt new york has never looked so inhospitable since " death wish " . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt for a scientist , this is very poor observation . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt  ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? 
neg/cv526_12868.txt 14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt new yorkers hate beta cam . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt don't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of " america's funniest home videos " . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the performances in the film are singularly bland . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt godzilla for the most part is okay . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park " , but with none of that film's suspense or tension . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt suffice to say that , " godzilla " is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt this is a film that needed the hype . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt with the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt if you've seen the trailers , you've seen the best parts . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt my only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt  . this film could be the next " rocky horror " . 
neg/cv526_12868.txt only it's not funny !

neg/cv439_17633.txt

neg/cv439_17633.txt you know the plot : a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be double-crossed by a fatal femme . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt in " palmetto , " the dimwit is harry barber ( woody harrelson ) , a reporter who's just been released from prison ( he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating ) . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt enter la femme : rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto , florida ( rolf hoppe ) . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt she and her stepdaughter odette ( chlo ? sevigny ) have a plot to extort 500k from the old man : harry will " kidnap " odette . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt after groping both women , harry agrees . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt as everyone except harry can see , he's being set up as a fall guy . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt sure enough , before long , harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt his brother-in-law ( tom wright ) , an assistant da , has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case , so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt ( and we get to watch him sweat-literally ) . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt there are several plot twists , of course-a couple of them even took me by surprise . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog , and they're on harry like he's the only bone in the kennel . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery's wolf to show up . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt her incredible performance in " leaving las vegas " seems to have been a fluke . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt here , she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt shue's character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt in addition to shue and sevigny , the kennel includes gina gershon ( who filled the dimwit-with-a-shady-past role in " bound " ) as harry's girlfriend nina ; when harry gets out of jail , she licks his face ( now there's a horndog ) . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt the parts are so overplayed that with a little push " palmetto " could have been an over-the-top parody of film noir a la " romeo is bleeding . " 
neg/cv439_17633.txt as it is , it's best watched at 2am on showtime ( the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channel's soft porn programs anyway ) . 
neg/cv439_17633.txt  " palmetto " has a well-known director , volker schl ? ndorff , who's best known for his adaptations of major literary works , especially " the tin drum . " 
neg/cv439_17633.txt i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot-by-numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake " cape fear . " 
neg/cv439_17633.txt schl ? ndorff tries hard-he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs-but nothing can freshen up this stale script . 


neg/cv184_26935.txt

neg/cv184_26935.txt it's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of " collectible " items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt well , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt here's the story . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the " cure " of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt  ( oh , how witty . ) 
neg/cv184_26935.txt she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ? 
neg/cv184_26935.txt it's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt and depardieu . . . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt how can a french guy have a bad french accent ? 
neg/cv184_26935.txt and never mind the toilet brush haircut . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he's a rottweiler . 
neg/cv184_26935.txt now that's funny . 


neg/cv738_10287.txt

neg/cv738_10287.txt well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt because thats all that there really is . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt i am not saying that this isn't possible . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt but it does leave one to wonder . . . i 
neg/cv738_10287.txt know i did . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt there was one scene that should have been short . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt ok enough already get on with it . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt this movie is also very predictable . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt it gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt even though there is still action going on . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt some of the characters are not proper for their roles . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt the special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt another thing is the destruction scenes . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt wow , those were masterpieces . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt one little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt i thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . . 
neg/cv738_10287.txt its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this . 


neg/cv124_3903.txt

neg/cv124_3903.txt  " something is fishy in the state of universal . " 
neg/cv124_3903.txt about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward " haircuts " of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt  ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) 
neg/cv124_3903.txt now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt  ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . ) 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called " smokers , " are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical " dryland , " the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the psycho ruler of the smokers , the " deacon , " is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , " deacon " is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the " mariner , " who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt very little is done with this . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt  ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) 
neg/cv124_3903.txt i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! 
neg/cv124_3903.txt this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt in sum , this movie is beneath contempt . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . 
neg/cv124_3903.txt otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks . 


neg/cv542_20359.txt

neg/cv542_20359.txt vikings v . bears ? 
neg/cv542_20359.txt no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in " the 13th warrior , " a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt help is needed quickly . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more " not of norse blood " are needed to ensure victory . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? 
neg/cv542_20359.txt it does not look promising . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt they are ready to sacrifice their lives . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt  " this is a good way to die , " says one of the fallen warriors . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt at many points , i was even confused . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity . 
neg/cv542_20359.txt it would make thor cry .
