pos/cv119_9867.txt disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt unfortunately , folks , it's not likely . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely " ok " to watch . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) 
pos/cv119_9867.txt there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! 
pos/cv119_9867.txt if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt it's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt  . 
pos/cv119_9867.txt an enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !

pos/cv347_13194.txt elmore leonard has quickly become one of hollywood's favorite authors . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt out of four film adaptations in as many years , the witty and inventive out of sight gives get shorty a run for its money as the best leonard adaptation around . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt george clooney stars as jack foley , a nice bank robber . . . you 
pos/cv347_13194.txt know the type , he uses his charm and his wits rather than a gun . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt but even charming guys end up unlucky , and jack ends up in jail . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt but not for long . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt he plots an escape with the help of his best friend , and fellow robber , buddy bragg ( ving rhames ) , and their slow-witted pothead associate , glenn michaels ( steve zahn ) . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt but jack didn't count on u . s . marshal karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt appearing at the right place at the wrong time , karen gets involved in foley's escape attempt and the subsequent manhunt to bring him in . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt however , karen develops a rapport with jack foley , and finds that she begrudgingly likes the guy . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt but , can love prosper on opposite sides of the law ? 
pos/cv347_13194.txt or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt clooney , who has had a string of solid , but never stellar , film roles , delivers his best performance to date . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt he blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley , who's willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt jennifer lopez does an excellent job as well . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt she actually has a trickier role than clooney , as a woman who has to balance her emotions with her sense of duty . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt she and clooney develop good chemistry together . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt the film boasts a superb ensemble . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt steve zahn gives a hilarious performance , and steals nearly every scene he's in . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex-con who may or may not be teaming up with foley . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt out of the cast , only dennis farina seems underused as karen's ex-lawman father . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt steven soderbergh gives the film sharp and stylistic direction . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt with an affectation for freeze frames , he delivers a unique take on the film's action and love scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt devoid of its bells and whistles , out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt however , there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare , and they pass quickly . 
pos/cv347_13194.txt with smart dialogue , good characters , and an excellent cast , out of sight easily smoothes over the rough spots in the plot and delivers on both the action and romantic fronts .

pos/cv338_8821.txt leonardo decaprio ( what's eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv's my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann's modernized version of william shakespeare's classic , romeo & juliet . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt surrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt the story starts off at a gas station , where the " montague boys " meet the " capulet boys " and square off with one another . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt symbolizing the swords of shakespeare's day were their weapons , like the " rapier-9mm " or the " longsword- shotgun . " 
pos/cv338_8821.txt instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo's best friend . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt mercutio , who in shakespeare's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt miriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet's nurse , even though she was never given a name . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare's version , only slightly changed in luhrmann's . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt now known as verona beach , the capulet's ( led by sorvino ) and montague's ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt sub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt this excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ? 
pos/cv338_8821.txt romeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories . 
pos/cv338_8821.txt with the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece .

pos/cv465_22431.txt  " rebel without a cause " is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and " rebel without a cause " successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt not only does " rebel without a cause " display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt this is because times change and in response people change . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same 
pos/cv465_22431.txt goes for brando , redford , even deniro . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? 
pos/cv465_22431.txt any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt even if " rebel without a cause " has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . 
pos/cv465_22431.txt now , however , the coolness is fading . . .

pos/cv410_24266.txt george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt after mr . and mrs . little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the " supporting cast " are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt stuart little is a charming family film . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
pos/cv410_24266.txt some moments that can only be described as " too cute " ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt kids and parents will love this one . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt get it ? 
pos/cv410_24266.txt it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt but wait . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there's still more ! 
pos/cv410_24266.txt there's a section called " basement treasures " where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt who to do , who to do , who to do " as the song begins . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like " i'll be your pleasure all the time . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt just say the words that you'll be mine " . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt um . . . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt what the hell ? 
pos/cv410_24266.txt what does this have to do with stuart little ? 
pos/cv410_24266.txt how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ? 
pos/cv410_24266.txt when the video concludes , the words " to be continued " appear . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost . 
pos/cv410_24266.txt the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar . 


pos/cv795_10122.txt

pos/cv795_10122.txt the central focus of michael winterbottom's " welcome to sarajevo " is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( " platoon " ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible " the walking dead " ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( " schindler's list " ) . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt the two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt the question is not what went right . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt the question is what went wrong . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt for one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that's about it . ) . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt the assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter " into " liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt still , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt and it's a plus , because he doesn't toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt he wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious .

pos/cv795_10122.txt rated r . __________________________________________________________ 
pos/cv795_10122.txt atom egoyan's powerfully meditative " the sweet hereafter " is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i've seen this year . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt ian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he's a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she's a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt and in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt it's one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i've ever seen . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near-revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for " breaking the waves " . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt  " the sweet hereafter " though , is atom egoyan's movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994's " exotica " , " the sweet hereafter " makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves : an artist . 
pos/cv795_10122.txt he interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common .

pos/cv909_9960.txt the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 
pos/cv909_9960.txt when the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt with the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt it's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt now it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_ . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt a perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt best of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt mulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt  ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) 
pos/cv909_9960.txt the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller " the day of the jackal " , comparison between the two films is inevitable . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt there is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt as a mystery , " the jackal " has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt holes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt for a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt willis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in " the saint " . 
pos/cv909_9960.txt  ( and lest you misunderstand , that's not a compliment . )

pos/cv707_10678.txt the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt what makes " peter's friends " so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
pos/cv707_10678.txt well . . . . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt 11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a " british 'big chill . ' " 
pos/cv707_10678.txt and in some ways it is . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt but while " the big chill " was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , " peter's friends " hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in " sense and sensibility " ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt as for peter , things seem okay . . . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt that's really what makes " peter's friends " so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears " everybody wants to rule the world , " but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old " come on eileen " ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt oh well . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt branagh's forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , " no , but we have hollywood " - punishment like that ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt  " peter's friends " is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don't know what kind i'll have ( like most people , i don't look forward to my high school reunion ) . 
pos/cv707_10678.txt because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that . 


pos/cv312_29377.txt

pos/cv312_29377.txt synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt review : one memorable aspect of disney's " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt  " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt all the same , " shrek " does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , " now i'm a flying talking donkey ! " 
pos/cv312_29377.txt and despite its many contributors , the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt  " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength . 
pos/cv312_29377.txt but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology . 


pos/cv629_14909.txt

pos/cv629_14909.txt i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt oddly , i've never given much thought to either of the two . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt yes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt it seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt as this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt for those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt chris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie's happiness . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt and when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt despair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt chris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie's fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt this film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt it's shape and look is as infinite as our imagination . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt certain questions baffle him at first . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt why does his home in heaven ooze with paint ? 
pos/cv629_14909.txt what is the significance of the asian stewardess ? 
pos/cv629_14909.txt why does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ? 
pos/cv629_14909.txt but as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt  " dreams " is both visually and tellingly beautiful . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt alas , i have one regret . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt however , your eyes will still well up with tears and you'll find lots to savor . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt the journey is imaginative . 
pos/cv629_14909.txt and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film .
