neg/cv318_11146.txt synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt  " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? 
neg/cv318_11146.txt let's start with the acting . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt it's pretty bad . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he'd be happy after watching this fluff . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt it's no wonder why she hated high school so much . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . 
neg/cv318_11146.txt if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .

neg/cv220_28906.txt at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? 
neg/cv220_28906.txt by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt swordfish is a very cynical movie . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt talk about whacked-out patriotism . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt my objections to swordfish are many . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt yea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt and that is not enough . 
neg/cv220_28906.txt this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .

neg/cv466_20092.txt running time approximately 1hr 40mins 
neg/cv466_20092.txt reviewed by jack choo 
neg/cv466_20092.txt rating : 
neg/cv466_20092.txt the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt existenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt  * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt during a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt  * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt as they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt even so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt in existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt jennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) 
neg/cv466_20092.txt which is actually quite good . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt 10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg . 
neg/cv466_20092.txt cronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you . 


neg/cv219_19874.txt

neg/cv219_19874.txt last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? 
neg/cv219_19874.txt the answer is just about everything . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt he's too much of a joker . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt i suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . 
neg/cv219_19874.txt after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

neg/cv094_27868.txt a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves .

neg/cv094_27868.txt as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . 
neg/cv094_27868.txt the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .

neg/cv909_9973.txt suicide kings is a terrible film . 
neg/cv909_9973.txt walken aside , there isn't a single appealing cast member .

neg/cv909_9973.txt the plot is another issue entirely . 
neg/cv909_9973.txt o'fallon is someone whom i'm betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times , for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return ( do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster , which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary's character , or the numerous anecdotal sequences ? ) , but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess , filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses . . .

neg/cv909_9973.txt it occurred to me then what's wrong with indies like suicide kings : i suspect o'fallon has never met a mobster , is not a rich man , doesn't deliver endless " clever " monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots . . .

neg/cv487_11058.txt adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt and then there's the music . . . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt 2 , 3 , and 4 ! 
neg/cv487_11058.txt while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard " keep your true love from marrying someone else " plot by making the rival a nice person . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt which leaves us with adam sandler . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt when he's in full nice-guy mode , he's more pathetic than endearing . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt but none of them work well at all . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film's finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) 
neg/cv487_11058.txt adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . 
neg/cv487_11058.txt while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . 


neg/cv257_11856.txt

neg/cv257_11856.txt you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the " odd couple ii " sneak preview . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt they were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt  " what a great movie , " exclaimed one gent at the urinal , " everything was so true ! " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt  " yeah , " laughed a man standing next to him , " i drive as slow as that one guy did . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt my kids give me holy hell for it ! " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt  " and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , " chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , " neil simon's the odd couple ii " may be just the film for you . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt others will likely be less charitable . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt while " the odd couple ii " is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of " wacky " adventures on the road . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : " grumpy old men , " " grumpier old men " and " out to sea . " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of " phnah ! 
neg/cv257_11856.txt phnah ! " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt i came up with four " god-damns , " three " shitheads " and two " fucks . " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word " san . " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt one of the oldest maxims of film-going is " beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . " 
neg/cv257_11856.txt  " neil simon's the odd couple ii " is no exception to the rule . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my " young-whippersnapper " ass to boot . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt one thing's for sure , though . 
neg/cv257_11856.txt they'll never catch me in a car chase . 


neg/cv103_11943.txt

neg/cv103_11943.txt if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word " cute " but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt maybe it will work for some people . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt it didn't work for me . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt sam is broke . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt max is dying . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt pass the kleenex . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt it's icky . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . 
neg/cv103_11943.txt and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . 


neg/cv845_15886.txt

neg/cv845_15886.txt what a contrast ! 
neg/cv845_15886.txt in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i'm not sure you could get two more different movies . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt this is one interesting movie . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? 
neg/cv845_15886.txt and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? 
neg/cv845_15886.txt  " it " means everything : television , friends , events that happen . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? 
neg/cv845_15886.txt this is not a movie for answers . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt that's what makes this movie stay on your mind . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt the performances are all superb in hurlyburly . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt first , it's depressing that such a world exists . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt where are the stories about women's world ? 
neg/cv845_15886.txt not the soap operas and the " chick flicks " that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt it's very talkative , intelligent and static . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . 
neg/cv845_15886.txt it also means that you have to pay attention .
