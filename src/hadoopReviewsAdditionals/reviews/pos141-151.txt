pos/cv702_11500.txt the characters in " palmetto " collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt as far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- " palmetto " spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt it's not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he's served a couple of years for a crime he didn't commit . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry's first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt while searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt rhea proposes a scheme that'll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny ) . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt  " you do like risks , don't you , mr . barber ? " 
pos/cv702_11500.txt rhea alluringly coos . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt boys , form a line behind me . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt part of " palmetto " 's success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in " leaving las vegas " might merely be foreshadowing great things to come . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt shue's a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt the other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( " kids " ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in " bound " and " showgirls . " 
pos/cv702_11500.txt harrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to " the people vs . larry flynt . " 
pos/cv702_11500.txt  " palmetto " does have its share of grievances . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt harrelson's narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon's nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt one of the plot's unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he's involved -- could have been played a little better . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt there are moments when you question the tone , but it's never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it's been receiving from most other critics . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt if " palmetto " didn't want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action " who framed roger rabbit " ? 
pos/cv702_11500.txt although a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt thanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer's suddenly re-popular " the tin drum , " right ? ) , 
pos/cv702_11500.txt everything runs smoothly . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt and for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film's got a few shocks in store that i won't even dream of revealing . 
pos/cv702_11500.txt  " palmetto " is a generous amount of fun to watch , and that's all you need to know . 


pos/cv889_21430.txt

pos/cv889_21430.txt so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt if they survive the night they get the money . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt if not well you get the jurisdiction . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt if they can they get the money , if not well they don't . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt everyone who was in there burned to death . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt one-by-one the people start to disappear . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the people find rooms , which once held mental patients . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt rooms which once had people dying . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt rooms which may still contain these people . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt i can say however i liked this movie . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . 
pos/cv889_21430.txt but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !

pos/cv593_10987.txt summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt on this occasion one of the roommates , pete ( ron eldard ) , brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt the stranger is zack ( bill paxton ) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt nothing could be further from the truth . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is , among other things , a racist " you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble we'd have picked the damn cotton ourselves " , and an anti-semite . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt after zack assaults marc ( jonathan penner ) and pete , zack is killed . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt the roommates are at odds with what to do . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt marc , pete and paulie ( annabeth gish ) immediately wish to call the police . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt luke ( courtney b . vance ) and jude ( cameron diaz ) suggest something different . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt if they all agree that the guest deserves to die , they will poison them and bury them in the back yard . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt the back yard fills up rather quickly , its' victims including ( among others ) a right to life extremist , an anti-environmentalist and a homophobe . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt are they giving the guests a chance ? 
pos/cv593_10987.txt are they even giving them good food anymore ? 
pos/cv593_10987.txt this film is what i like to call a " hidden treasure " . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt this film is such a pleasant surprise . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt a well written , devilish satire that is funny , sexy and original . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt this film should be a hit , but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldn't give it much of a chance . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt stacy title does a wonderful job directing . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt >from the five members of the house to other key characters including sheriff stanley ( nora dunn ) , the local law closing in on the truth , and the dream dinner guest , norman arbuthnot ( ron perlman ) , a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt perlman gives the films' best performance . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends and gains followers , and may just inadvertently talk his way out of death . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt the other actors are convincing as well , as all of the roommates deal with their murderous ways . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt some of the characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity , while others grieve their decisions . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt when friends ask me to recommend a movie , this is usually the first one i think of . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt i am not saying that this is my favorite movie ( although it is in my top ten ) , but because the film was such a wonderful surprise , i have a fondness for it . 
pos/cv593_10987.txt i also try to recommend films like this : ones that have not been seen by many people , but should . 


pos/cv638_2953.txt

pos/cv638_2953.txt natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt both films glamorize " outlaws , " in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt both relate the story of a couple liberated by love . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt brahma created . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt vishnu preserved . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt muslims kill christians . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt hindus kill muslims . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt christians kill pagans . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt religion is an orgy of killing . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt  " the state is the divine idea upon earth , " hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
pos/cv638_2953.txt let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt  ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) 
pos/cv638_2953.txt catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it is a straightforward liberation through sex . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt as some good patriarch once observed , " you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt  " the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , " as mickey says . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt  " neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans " : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt who else has found it ? --the 
pos/cv638_2953.txt man of today ? -- " i 
pos/cv638_2953.txt don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in " --so sighs the man of today . . . . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this tolerance and largeur of the heart that " forgives " everything because it " understands " everything is a sirocco to us . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! 
pos/cv638_2953.txt as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , " if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , " in his most excellent bill and ted voice . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her " the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt also , jungian archetypes abound . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey to mallory : " one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , " in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the two of course go hand in hand . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey during his marriage to mallory : " as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this is what mickey means by " creator of my universe , " he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : " old man , go be a snake , " after telling his " snake story " that ends with " bitch , you knew i was a snake . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , " you killed life ! ! ! " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt then what were they killing up to that time ? 
pos/cv638_2953.txt in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt it of course symbolizes rebirth . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : " mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt this is reminiscent of nietzsche's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey : " the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey ( again in his interview ) : " me and you , we are not the same species . " 
pos/cv638_2953.txt notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . 
pos/cv638_2953.txt mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang .

pos/cv393_29327.txt plot : odin is a great high school basketball player . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt he's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt unfortunately , the coach's real son , hugo , isn't too pleased to hear that . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt in fact , he doesn't like hearing about any of odin's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt so what does he set out to do ? 
pos/cv393_29327.txt well , let's just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to . . . well , 
pos/cv393_29327.txt you'll see . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted " non-teen " movie starring a bunch of teens . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me ) . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt i did have a few reservations about the movie though . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ? 
pos/cv393_29327.txt it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt the film was also edited pretty choppily . . . like 
pos/cv393_29327.txt some scenes were cut out and no one " cleaned it up " afterwards . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt i also didn't like the fact that hartnett's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more " realism " under some of the circumstances . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt but overall , the movie will devastate you . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt it's not a " fun date movie " . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt it's not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt it's about jealousy , love , envy , fury , passion , revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that's ever passed through your head . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt is it worth seeing ? 
pos/cv393_29327.txt oh , most definitely ! 
pos/cv393_29327.txt  ( pun intended ) it's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director's choice of music near the end . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that's saying something right there . 
pos/cv393_29327.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv393_29327.txt 10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - election ( 7/10 ) - hamlet ( 6/10 ) - love's labor's lost ( 8/10 ) - natural born killers ( 9/10 ) - save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - shakespeare in love ( 5/10 )

pos/cv712_22920.txt when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say " i'll be right back , " etc . ) . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt was this wes craven's remedy from making " real " bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? 
pos/cv712_22920.txt it just seemed cheap to me . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt this is part of the fun of watching scream . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . 
pos/cv712_22920.txt so who knows . 


pos/cv984_12767.txt

pos/cv984_12767.txt now that " boogie nights " has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's " the last days of disco . " 
pos/cv984_12767.txt stillman , who made " metropolitan " and " barcelona " using some of the same actors , uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) 
pos/cv984_12767.txt men and women of " the last days of disco " frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt if talk is cheap , " the last days of disco " must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of " the lady and the tramp " ) . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt na ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , " like a kindergarten teacher . " 
pos/cv984_12767.txt the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt here they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he's gay . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt whether it's true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of " barcelona " ? ) .

pos/cv984_12767.txt and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt while the eschewing of " ferocious pairing " is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the " preferred " dynamics of social group interaction . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt more mature than stillman's previous two films , " the last days of disco " is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . 
pos/cv984_12767.txt it's a movie you should definitely get on down to . 


pos/cv818_10211.txt

pos/cv818_10211.txt it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt in between , he has moonlighted as an " actor " with several decidedly unmemorable performances . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt jackie brown's lone " innovation " is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's " banyon " ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . 
pos/cv818_10211.txt it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . 


pos/cv780_7984.txt

pos/cv780_7984.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . 
pos/cv780_7984.txt my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . 


pos/cv391_10802.txt

pos/cv391_10802.txt i'm not really sure what to think about " crash . " 
pos/cv391_10802.txt on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt  " crash " is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of " henry and june " or the just plain horniness of , say , " deep throat " ( not that i've seen it ) . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole " auto eroticism " thing . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of " the game " ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt then when it happens , we hold our breath . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt these people are merely taking it to another level . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt but still , they coulda cut it down a bit . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt and there are several scenes are just amazing . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt while james spader is pretty boring ( he's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt she speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she's enjoying it or not . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he's getting a freaky tatoo . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in " teenage mutant ninja turtles " ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he's capable of bigger roles . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt while i hardly enjoyed " crash , " it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . 
pos/cv391_10802.txt despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there's also an r-rated version , but i wouldn't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno .
