pos/cv004_11636.txt moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt in the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt  ( chan's first release in this country , " rumble in the bronx " , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) 
pos/cv004_11636.txt heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , " jackie , save us ! " , and misuse firearms . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt just go see the movie . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt operation condor has pretentions of being a " raiders of the lost ark " knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . 
pos/cv004_11636.txt however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .

pos/cv758_9671.txt devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick " doogie howser " harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from " beverly hills 90210 . " 
pos/cv758_9671.txt so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? 
pos/cv758_9671.txt for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt in this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era " why we fight " series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt these characters really are just " fresh meat for the grinder , " as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt it's not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt in fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt if that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody's business . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way . 
pos/cv758_9671.txt that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . 


pos/cv021_15838.txt

pos/cv021_15838.txt one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt sometimes the stories are compelling . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt sometimes they're not . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt star trek : insurrection is no exception . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt i simply enjoyed the film . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? 
pos/cv021_15838.txt insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . 
pos/cv021_15838.txt i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . 


pos/cv880_29800.txt

pos/cv880_29800.txt for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt slow is the best description for the film at first . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . 
pos/cv880_29800.txt it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . 


pos/cv815_22456.txt

pos/cv815_22456.txt you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt that's a bit more difficult . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt if you're not nice to it , you lose . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt  " the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . " 
pos/cv815_22456.txt that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt taking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " , 
pos/cv815_22456.txt chen's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , won't take it or something . " 
pos/cv815_22456.txt it's a hoot , but it doesn't stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren't far behind . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season . 
pos/cv815_22456.txt by grabthar's hammer , this is a hell of a movie . 


pos/cv048_16828.txt

pos/cv048_16828.txt when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt cool . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? 
pos/cv048_16828.txt have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? 
pos/cv048_16828.txt it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt but the joy in a film like this is in the little details . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt through coal-mining . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . 
pos/cv048_16828.txt another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . 


pos/cv910_20488.txt

pos/cv910_20488.txt it's terribly unfortunate that " stir of echoes , " tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , " the trigger effect " ) , should be released little more than a month after " the sixth sense , " which is still going strong at the box office . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , " stir of echoes " is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while " the sixth sense " is closer to a psychological drama . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt additionally , while " the sixth sense " had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , " stir of echoes " is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt and where " the sixth sense " was disturbing , " stir of echoes " is just plain scary . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , " stir of echoes " opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt finally , he asks , " does it hurt to be dead ? " 
pos/cv910_20488.txt apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike " the sixth sense , " this young child isn't the focus of the picture . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt  " stir of echoes " isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's " dream with the fishes " ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt in a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is " sleep . " 
pos/cv910_20488.txt never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt truthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt having loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995's " to die for , " her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl , she remarks , " i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she's dead gives one pause . " 
pos/cv910_20488.txt also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994's " intersection " ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998's " whatever , " as morrison's grieving teenage sister , debbie . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt if the resolution of " stir of echoes " does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . 
pos/cv910_20488.txt  " stir of echoes " isn't as good as " the sixth sense , " but why should it need to be ? 
pos/cv910_20488.txt both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and " stir of echoes " really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . 


pos/cv572_18657.txt

pos/cv572_18657.txt with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with " trinity " ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as " morpheus " ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually " the one " prophesized to come and save the world . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? 
pos/cv572_18657.txt and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? 
pos/cv572_18657.txt unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt the matrix isn't a classic . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . 
pos/cv572_18657.txt just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . 


pos/cv474_10209.txt

pos/cv474_10209.txt let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt the new " m " is a woman ) . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt  " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from " dr . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt they make a great team . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt  " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt it's time to put them to use in something truly special . 
pos/cv474_10209.txt there's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .

pos/cv738_10116.txt

pos/cv738_10116.txt here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's " penance " ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt that film is amistad . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange " rituals " . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as " sub-human , " so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his " pretty boy " image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than " abolitionists . " 
pos/cv738_10116.txt nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt there is no such figure in amistad . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . 
pos/cv738_10116.txt it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history .
