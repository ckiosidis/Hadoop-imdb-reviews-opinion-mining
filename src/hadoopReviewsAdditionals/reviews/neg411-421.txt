neg/cv344_5376.txt any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt unfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt teamwork was the key . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma's " blow out , " where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt it was travolta's vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt in this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there's no fun going on here whatsoever . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt there are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt tom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby " the brain " heenan than jim phelps . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt brian depalma's career has been bafflingly erratic . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt at his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( " blow out , " " carrie , " " body double " ) but this is not his best . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in " chinatown , " but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt the cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old " killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape " trick . 
neg/cv344_5376.txt please don't spend your money on this ; it'll only encourage hollywood to make more .

neg/cv620_2556.txt  " looks like he zigged when he should've zagged . " 
neg/cv620_2556.txt - ernie hudson , as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt comic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt despite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee's final film doesn't fly very high . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt the story opens on halloween eve , better known as devil's night . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt wilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt the cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt she dies , the perps . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt escape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt sound familiar ? 
neg/cv620_2556.txt unlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee's character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 . by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt wearing what appears to be alice cooper's leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt but no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt  ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt  : ) 
neg/cv620_2556.txt a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt his two " best " set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt blame said editors for the film's frightful flashbacks , as well . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt but the pace is quick , thank god , and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt the cast is better than it should be . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film's funnier lines . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and draven's scrappy ward . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt jon polito has a small , succulent role as pungent pawnbroker . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr . big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt there can be only one . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt finally , there's brandon lee , son of bruce lee , and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt lee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie , laser mission , showdown in little toyko , and rapid fire-- and the crow would've been a nice feather in his belt and that's about it . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt there's nothing great from him here-- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt when the echo of that gunshot finally fades , watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt despite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity , the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren . 
neg/cv620_2556.txt for now , maybe it's an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better . 


neg/cv494_18689.txt

neg/cv494_18689.txt you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and " suggested by " a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt first , we have the prison warden subplot . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt there's also the prison guard subplot . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt and then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are " takers , " that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? 
neg/cv494_18689.txt if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . 
neg/cv494_18689.txt if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors .

neg/cv577_28220.txt around the end of 1998 , a japanese cartoon came to the usa television , and really wasn't that big . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn't all that bad . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , " pokemon : the movie 2000 " which is far inferior to the original animated movie . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt first up is the plot , which there really isn't much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt well there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt even though the first movie wasn't a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt this new movie however is nothing but garbage , there is nothing good to it storywise , and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt compared to the first film , this movie is awfully bland , from its opening titles , to the end titles it tries its best to work , but fails miserably at every corner . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt the characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt even the so called action scenes are extremely lame , and falls before it even gets a chance to go . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt the voices even aren't that good and almost feels like the stars don't want to be there , like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt which it certainly is . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation , although not up to disney standards , it is still very good with some interesting cgi's and very colorful animation , the colors jump out at you very fast , and seem very nicely put on film . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered , hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt for now watch the first one . 
neg/cv577_28220.txt its much much better .

neg/cv877_29132.txt how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ? 
neg/cv877_29132.txt easy . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt and while you're at it make it borrr-ring . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film " the princess diaries . " 
neg/cv877_29132.txt you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride " --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working . . . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt and hardly * any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? 
neg/cv877_29132.txt not really . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product . 
neg/cv877_29132.txt lame , labored , and lamentable , " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) . 


neg/cv205_9676.txt

neg/cv205_9676.txt the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . 
neg/cv205_9676.txt oh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . 
neg/cv205_9676.txt after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection . 
neg/cv205_9676.txt the second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) .

neg/cv205_9676.txt which one is the killer ? 
neg/cv205_9676.txt well , it doesn't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won't take his choice seriously anyway . 
neg/cv205_9676.txt the whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn't follow . 
neg/cv205_9676.txt and through the whole thing there's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal .

neg/cv811_22646.txt

neg/cv811_22646.txt when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the " unseen " terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt there really isn't much of a story here . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt and the special effects are great . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the " cool shots " quota . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt but not scary . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt then we have the set . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt what part did these rooms play in the story ? 
neg/cv811_22646.txt absolutely none . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt then we have the actors . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt lili taylor has never been one of my favorites . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt i have no idea why liam neeson took this role . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt all catherine has to do in this movie is look good . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt fortunately that is something she does very well . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt my advice ? 
neg/cv811_22646.txt if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt if it's scares you want , rent halloween . 
neg/cv811_22646.txt either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting .

neg/cv121_18621.txt plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt critique : despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott's worst acting performances . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this " black comedy " ( if you're gonna create a black comedy , don't chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt i barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you're gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt this one's not even worth the rental , fellas . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt skip it altogether ! 
neg/cv121_18621.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott's first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could've passed for hanks 15 years ago . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt it wasn't until hanks' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt the actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv's " saved by the bell " . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt his parents are dutch and named hans and paula . 
neg/cv121_18621.txt and who would've guessed that this is director alan cohn's first shot at directing a feature film ? 


neg/cv401_13758.txt

neg/cv401_13758.txt i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing " disturbing behavior " with " scream . " 
neg/cv401_13758.txt maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt but this is not the next in line with the " scream " flicks as well as the " i know what you did last summer " soon to be flicks . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it owes less to " halloween " and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt and it should have been . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt this is basically a rehash of " the stepford wives , " the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt or something like that . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt  " behavior , " starring katie holmes of " dawson's creek , " deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt suck-ups . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt preppies . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like " beautiful girls " and " things to do in denver when you're dead " ( as well as " con air " ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as " the movies with potential that blow it . " 
neg/cv401_13758.txt i remember a film called " white man's burden " which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt here's another one . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt now it just needs to work as a film . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt which it doesn't . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it's too sloppy and too contrived . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then 
neg/cv401_13758.txt lets it lie . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then 
neg/cv401_13758.txt gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? 
neg/cv401_13758.txt the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from " dawson's creek " ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from " the man without a face " ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt gavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt here , we have another case of " the idiot plot , " where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt the only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but 
neg/cv401_13758.txt really , we don't care anyway . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for " the x-files , " because that would probably tarnish his reputation . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt like the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt he keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt what this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt if he's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? 
neg/cv401_13758.txt the film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . 
neg/cv401_13758.txt at such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one's mouth , especially mine . 


neg/cv137_17020.txt

neg/cv137_17020.txt the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt unfortunately , the film never takes off from there . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt false scares should always be used in moderation . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? 
neg/cv137_17020.txt this movie still adheres to them . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt that type of illogical can be fun . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt actually , you won't be screaming at all . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt at its best , the acting can barely be called " adequate " and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the film still manages to have some strong points . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt there are some intentionally funny moments . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt  ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) 
neg/cv137_17020.txt the film is well made from a technical standpoint . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . 
neg/cv137_17020.txt if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money .
