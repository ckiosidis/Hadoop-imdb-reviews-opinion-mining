neg/cv206_15893.txt this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , " the prince of egypt " remains shallow . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt but i'll begin from the beginning . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt most of all , though , the story's focus has shifted . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , " the prince of egypt " is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt  * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt but enough about the differences . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt let's talk about the movie itself . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn't convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt it features a cookie-cutter " i-wanna-please-dada " rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things ) . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the " new-improved " miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt speaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt it contains shallow writing . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt most of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . 
neg/cv206_15893.txt the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . 


neg/cv951_11816.txt

neg/cv951_11816.txt the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the " hook " that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? 
neg/cv951_11816.txt apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called " mercury . " 
neg/cv951_11816.txt to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a " nerds' puzzle magazine . " 
neg/cv951_11816.txt of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt bruce willis' star seems to be fading . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt willis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt for those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt hopefully , the advent of summer will change that . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt until then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . 
neg/cv951_11816.txt and , if you're determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . 


neg/cv277_20467.txt

neg/cv277_20467.txt there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ? 
neg/cv277_20467.txt the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt come on people get some new ideas already ! 
neg/cv277_20467.txt what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt 'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . 
neg/cv277_20467.txt even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours . 


neg/cv123_12165.txt

neg/cv123_12165.txt you don't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt that should have been the end of the movie right there . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! " 
neg/cv123_12165.txt at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt they're both unbelievably wooden . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like " species ii . " 
neg/cv123_12165.txt last year peter hyams gave us " the relic " ; no thanks necessary there . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt and the first " species " was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt is it just that there are no better offers out there ? 
neg/cv123_12165.txt  " species ii " is worthless . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt there is . 
neg/cv123_12165.txt after 92 minutes , it ends . 


neg/cv408_5367.txt

neg/cv408_5367.txt when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt worse , actually . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer's secret diary . " 
neg/cv408_5367.txt for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt wrong ! 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers . 
neg/cv408_5367.txt but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie . 


neg/cv573_29384.txt

neg/cv573_29384.txt synopsis : original " jurassic park " survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt grant's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt review : there is one reason why " jurassic park iii " is better than its immediate predecessor , " the lost world : jurassic park " . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94 . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt the first " park " was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt its two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt at least this third entry realises it ; whereas " the lost world " tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , " jurassic park iii " simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ? 
neg/cv573_29384.txt nothing in this rehash even comes close . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman , payne and taylor , and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni , and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts . 
neg/cv573_29384.txt at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character , and there is much less gore than in " the lost world " , making this installment more suitable for children . 


neg/cv792_3257.txt

neg/cv792_3257.txt there's a good , and timely , story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first , a new movie about the abuses of our prison system . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies--a point of view . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt there's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt and everything suffers . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate , respectively . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape , bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt his young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to " put alcatraz on trial " for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt there's very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon's earnest overacting and the appropriate story . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt there's a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you're in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge , the center of reason and moderation . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt slater has never been convincing and certainly isn't here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters , let alone with them . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt if there's anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world , it is our ability to tell a good story . 
neg/cv792_3257.txt have we forgotten ? 


neg/cv168_7435.txt

neg/cv168_7435.txt except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly's ( paula marshall ) wedding . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt in molly's search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly's paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan's wife rowena ( gail o'grady ) in bed . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt i'm no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt the message seemed to be " ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . " 
neg/cv168_7435.txt  " family values " aside , there's something cruel about all this . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt lilly's husband is a new-age flake who rambles about " emotional valet parking , " so we can write him off as irrelevant . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt dan's wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt molly's husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she's too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan's wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt everyone else falls in love . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt but still , that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main characters . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt  " he's a prick " or " she's a bitch " is no defense . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) . 
neg/cv168_7435.txt other than that , it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick . 


neg/cv134_23300.txt

neg/cv134_23300.txt what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! " 
neg/cv134_23300.txt and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt confused ? 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt some hero . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . 
neg/cv134_23300.txt why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .
