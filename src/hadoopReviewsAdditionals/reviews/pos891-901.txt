pos/cv351_15458.txt though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there's something about elizabeth . . . that 
pos/cv351_15458.txt left me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn't care about the characters . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt to me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt and though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt before she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt as a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt much of the film deals with elizabeth's love for lord robert , a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt there is much ado about her lack of a husband , and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece , as love interests are such a character driven element . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt i didn't much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen's most loyal advisor , sir francis , and attenborough as a well-meaning but old-fashioned lead council . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt why then , you must be asking , do i recommend elizabeth ? 
pos/cv351_15458.txt simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches , cellars and castles in 16th century europe . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from windows . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt indeed , elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade , ranking with kundun and braveheart . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt watch also for the incredibly " godfather-esque " mass murder scene . 
pos/cv351_15458.txt it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films . 


pos/cv130_17083.txt

pos/cv130_17083.txt while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like " serpico " and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from " the wonder years " , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . 
pos/cv130_17083.txt anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .

pos/cv509_15888.txt as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
pos/cv509_15888.txt well , the commercial part is . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
pos/cv509_15888.txt meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt but , i like her best when she's , well , perky . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt all i know is that i just like them both . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt here , the setup is a little different . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt she is also having an affair , of sorts . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named " shop around the corner " , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight " to the death ! ! " . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no " let's have sex tonight " mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 
pos/cv509_15888.txt thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt he is , i believe , america's greatest actor . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt does he show it here ? 
pos/cv509_15888.txt nah . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt which is what this movie boils down to . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it's pure confection . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt there are some immense flaws , like pacing . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt e-mail ? 
pos/cv509_15888.txt when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt they just work together , and it's nice to see . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it gives you , well , a smile . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . 
pos/cv509_15888.txt it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

pos/cv314_14422.txt the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 ) 
pos/cv314_14422.txt starring : tim curry and susan sarandon 
pos/cv314_14422.txt cult films are never mainstream . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ? ' . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt period . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt they go to a castle to try to use the phone . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt the acting is pretty good overall . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt even the singer meatloaf is in it ! ! 
pos/cv314_14422.txt the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt meatloaf sings like meatloaf . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt sadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose . 
pos/cv314_14422.txt if you want to see a different film , watch this one ! ! 


pos/cv307_25270.txt

pos/cv307_25270.txt clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt and in what room , and with what object . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt to this day , whenever someone says the phrase " well , to make a long story short " i have the follow up phrase " too late " ready to go . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt clue is available on dvd from paramount home video . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt a french language audio track is also available . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke ) . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the first two endings being " what if ? " 
pos/cv307_25270.txt endings and the third ending being the actual ending . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt now for the dvd release you get two choices . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt  ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) 
pos/cv307_25270.txt now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? 
pos/cv307_25270.txt maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt finally , the back of the dvd case states " and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings " . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . 
pos/cv307_25270.txt the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

pos/cv492_18271.txt

pos/cv492_18271.txt it's an interesting premise . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is " the one " who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt >from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt what is reality ? 
pos/cv492_18271.txt what is a sham ? 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the film turns our very perception of life on its side . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 
pos/cv492_18271.txt reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really " utilized " keanu reeves ? 
pos/cv492_18271.txt more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt very surprising for a sci-fi movie . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt of special note is the use of the " freeze and turn " effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt pretty slick . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the matrix drips with style . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt the film is not without its faults . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt some of the scenes and ideas are " borrowed " a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke . 
pos/cv492_18271.txt however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .

pos/cv900_10331.txt in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt how is the titanic a character ? 
pos/cv900_10331.txt you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! 
pos/cv900_10331.txt it might not be the best movie in the world . . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . 
pos/cv900_10331.txt during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .

pos/cv304_28706.txt body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells .

pos/cv304_28706.txt after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses .

pos/cv304_28706.txt the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either " mission : impossible " movie . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt director robert rodriguez ( " from dusk to dawn " ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family .

pos/cv304_28706.txt antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ? a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . 
pos/cv304_28706.txt regardless , " spy kids " is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike .

pos/cv176_12857.txt

pos/cv176_12857.txt a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
pos/cv176_12857.txt i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) 
pos/cv176_12857.txt i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , " a graduate of several 12-step programs . " 
pos/cv176_12857.txt stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt then , disaster strikes . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt although smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt also , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt although filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt for a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called " serious dramas " of today . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . 
pos/cv176_12857.txt you'll laugh . . . you'll 
pos/cv176_12857.txt cry . . . . it's 
pos/cv176_12857.txt all there . 


pos/cv122_7392.txt

pos/cv122_7392.txt warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film " fail-safe . " 
pos/cv122_7392.txt if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt -------------------- " fail-safe " ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
pos/cv122_7392.txt screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
pos/cv122_7392.txt review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt this is the theme of sidney lumet's " fail-safe , " a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  " fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  " what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? " 
pos/cv122_7392.txt a guest asks impatiently . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  " forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  " fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? 
pos/cv122_7392.txt is it wise ? 
pos/cv122_7392.txt is it even logical ? 
pos/cv122_7392.txt no , not really . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) 
pos/cv122_7392.txt with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . ) 
pos/cv122_7392.txt it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt  " fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . 
pos/cv122_7392.txt it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .
