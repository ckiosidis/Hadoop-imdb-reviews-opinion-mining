neg/cv734_22821.txt i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt unfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt it grows tiresome and monotonous . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt nerves , you see . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt and i believe it . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt the problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt i guess he is mistaken . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt `any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt many football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt in return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt for instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt unfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt pacino makes some interesting progress with his character . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt you begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt `any given sunday' is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique . 
neg/cv734_22821.txt and a very distant back seat , at that .

neg/cv192_16079.txt to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the film industry is like any other . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt in order for studios to survive , they have to make money . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt i'm not suggesting that " patch adams " was tossed out just to rake in the bucks . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt hunter " patch " adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt he writes in patch's academic file that he shows " excessive happiness . " 
neg/cv192_16079.txt i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt then it struck me . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt it must be based on a true story . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt robin williams is an amazing actor . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt that's what makes his failure here so remarkable . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt something holds him back . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history .

neg/cv192_16079.txt  " patch " is a good title for the film . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt there's a touching death . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt then there's another . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt worst of all is the final courtroom bit .

neg/cv192_16079.txt williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt it has as much emotion as his earlier statement " humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species " contains truth . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt shadyac also directed the first " ace ventura " movie . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt oedekerk directed the second one . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt need i say more ? 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care . 
neg/cv192_16079.txt the " doctors are not gods " theme will resonate with a number of people , but it's so poorly produced that no one will care .

neg/cv655_12055.txt my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt he was not amused . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . ' 
neg/cv655_12055.txt it's enough to melt the most callous heart . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . ' 
neg/cv655_12055.txt she is only half right . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt peter medak , the director , knows his business . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt james cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt marg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt natasha is an exquisite ornament . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up . 
neg/cv655_12055.txt michael madsen was there .

neg/cv458_9000.txt

neg/cv458_9000.txt by starring in amy heckerling's " clueless " two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's " batman & robin , " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt now , she's the star and producer of " excess baggage , " a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt but before the police can " rescue " her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt for at least a half-hour , " excess baggage " bounces along fast and efficiently . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and " excess baggage " likely covers its territory . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt  " do you like my tummy ? " 
neg/cv458_9000.txt emily coos to vincent at one point in the film . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt huh ? 
neg/cv458_9000.txt did i miss something ? 
neg/cv458_9000.txt the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt then again , " excess baggage " becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt  " excess baggage " has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand . 
neg/cv458_9000.txt i loved silverstone's turn in " clueless " as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's " emma . " 
neg/cv458_9000.txt looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for " excess baggage . " 
neg/cv458_9000.txt sadly , however , " excess baggage " is no " clueless . " 
neg/cv458_9000.txt but , on the other hand , it is clueless . 


neg/cv467_26610.txt

neg/cv467_26610.txt in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt i guess i was expecting some sort of political question . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt  " in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? " 
neg/cv467_26610.txt he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt and he has to ask to borrow clothing . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt too many coincidences in the story work against greg . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt but we do not really see much of that digging . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt randy newman has written a playful score . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me . 
neg/cv467_26610.txt i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

neg/cv697_12106.txt paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms . 
neg/cv697_12106.txt as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up . 
neg/cv697_12106.txt benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role . 
neg/cv697_12106.txt roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems .

neg/cv697_12106.txt if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium .

neg/cv073_23039.txt late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute " it can be . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love .

neg/cv073_23039.txt scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) .

neg/cv073_23039.txt you know , the average porn star . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted .

neg/cv073_23039.txt in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt the direction is film-school-grad obvious . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . 
neg/cv073_23039.txt this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that .

neg/cv749_18960.txt

neg/cv749_18960.txt the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and " shocking " plot developments . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt  ( sunderland actually asks brenner , " why was she killed ? " 
neg/cv749_18960.txt to which i would have answered , " if i knew , then the movie would already be over . " ) 
neg/cv749_18960.txt only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . 
neg/cv749_18960.txt the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .

neg/cv403_6721.txt the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt with eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt murphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt with his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott ) . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt finding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt but all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt metro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt in the first place , korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up ) . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt a reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt you can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three-dimensional character , and murphy is never able to reconcile the two . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt the script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling . 
neg/cv403_6721.txt an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out " point c ! " while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen .
