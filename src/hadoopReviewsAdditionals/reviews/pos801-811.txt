pos/cv082_11080.txt a big surprise to me . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt they replaced him just fine . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt it's just the music . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt the only real problems i had was the special effects . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt these were superfluous and a waste of money . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . 
pos/cv082_11080.txt the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .

pos/cv786_22497.txt david lynch's " blue velvet " begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a " strange world " of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt thankfully , the obscurity that " blue velvet " relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt  " blue velvet " miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt however , for fans of odd difficult indies , " blue velvet " could be just what they are looking for . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt it is very hard to discuss " blue velvet " without discussing the performance of dennis hopper's sadistic frank . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt laura dern was consistently annoying . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt just like his villain in " speed " , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt  " blue velvet " has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt for this sole reason it is recommended . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt but also see it to admire lynch's obsession to avoid the norm . 
pos/cv786_22497.txt even if this film is a little too weird for you , it's hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it . 


pos/cv034_29647.txt

pos/cv034_29647.txt plot : derek zoolander is a male model . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt he is also very dumb and impressionable . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? 
pos/cv034_29647.txt will zoolander ever grace the world his new " look " ? 
pos/cv034_29647.txt is this a funny movie ? 
pos/cv034_29647.txt find out below . . . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt critique : there's a place in our world for " stupid comedies " . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to " relax " by watching something so completely frivolous . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the " stupid " , but consider it funny instead . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt snap ! 
pos/cv034_29647.txt it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt hi-larious ! 
pos/cv034_29647.txt but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and " orgy " sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just " make up " a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! 
pos/cv034_29647.txt i almost pissed myself during the " gas station " disaster , absolutely adored the " walk-off " contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( " i was a merman . . . a 
pos/cv034_29647.txt merman ! ! " ) . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt and i dare you to get his " monkey " photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( " you're a monkey , derek . . . a 
pos/cv034_29647.txt monkey ! " ) 
pos/cv034_29647.txt i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . 
pos/cv034_29647.txt blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! 
pos/cv034_29647.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv034_29647.txt austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 ) 


pos/cv098_15435.txt

pos/cv098_15435.txt meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) 
pos/cv098_15435.txt starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani 
pos/cv098_15435.txt in " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt that's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? 
pos/cv098_15435.txt besides eternal damnation , of course . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt  " meet joe black " runs just under three hours . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt  " meet joe black " is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt hopkins gives his usual excellent performance . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt so , " meet joe black " is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time . 
pos/cv098_15435.txt had the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . 


pos/cv127_14711.txt

pos/cv127_14711.txt urban legend surprised me . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the 
pos/cv127_14711.txt only person you didn't suspect ! 
pos/cv127_14711.txt however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and " cybil " actress alicia witt ) . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt one problem , though . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? 
pos/cv127_14711.txt i thought not . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! 
pos/cv127_14711.txt a decapitation . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt so who is it this time ? 
pos/cv127_14711.txt the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt a-ha . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? 
pos/cv127_14711.txt like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . 
pos/cv127_14711.txt and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .

pos/cv932_13401.txt

pos/cv932_13401.txt armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt but i loved every freaking minute of it . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt i'm sorry , but " somebody dial 911 ! ! ! " 
pos/cv932_13401.txt isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( " beam me up scotty " - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt of course , you all know the story . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt basically , that's about it . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? 
pos/cv932_13401.txt another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! 
pos/cv932_13401.txt want another one ? 
pos/cv932_13401.txt okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing " leaving on a jet plane " , and soon , all the rest join in . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? 
pos/cv932_13401.txt but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . 
pos/cv932_13401.txt so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out . 


pos/cv663_13019.txt

pos/cv663_13019.txt synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt  ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) 
pos/cv663_13019.txt in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt  ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) 
pos/cv663_13019.txt mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? 
pos/cv663_13019.txt opinion : east meets west . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? 
pos/cv663_13019.txt yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt but even the tiniest details reveal quality . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt balance is crucial . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! 
pos/cv663_13019.txt the dream team . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . 
pos/cv663_13019.txt it's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color .

pos/cv769_8123.txt men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the mib are responsible for " saving the world from the scum of the universe " . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt a though job , indeed . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt presumably , these " aliens " are all migrant workers . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the device , described as " out of state " , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt >from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt edwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt edwards doesn't take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt back at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt he informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt he has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt after goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the " criminal " on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt in the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt edgar ( vincent d'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the " bug " , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt and it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt screenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt and the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt all ages will enjoy men in black . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt the ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done . 
pos/cv769_8123.txt a sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to ! 


pos/cv911_20260.txt

pos/cv911_20260.txt usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt this is where the film takes a turn for the better . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt  " blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt that is until they aquire " invisible boy " ( kel mitchell ) , and " the bowler " ( janeane garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt for one , the film is considerably clever . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt a part of the cleverness comes from the cast . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt one was paul reuben . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt no matter how disgusting or revolting " mr . splein " may be , you still can't help but laugh . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt janeane garafalo also was an interesting character . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt stupid ? 
pos/cv911_20260.txt maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed . 
pos/cv911_20260.txt no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . 


pos/cv671_5054.txt

pos/cv671_5054.txt along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt it was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt braveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 ! 
pos/cv671_5054.txt i've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt for now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia . 
pos/cv671_5054.txt it won't be easy ! 
pos/cv671_5054.txt it's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson .
