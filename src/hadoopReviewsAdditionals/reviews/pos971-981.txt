pos/cv745_12773.txt in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt horrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows " the rule of 6 . " 
pos/cv745_12773.txt if you don't break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt and most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has " protection ? " 
pos/cv745_12773.txt she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn't choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt this delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt first , he's an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt next , he's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt william is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt rosmary's trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt as much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt all of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt in the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt even here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt the hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . 
pos/cv745_12773.txt it is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature .

pos/cv747_16556.txt edward zwick's " the siege " raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt its subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt denzel washington is anthony " hub " hubbard , who runs the fbi's anti-terrorism task force in new york . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of people . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative ( annette bening ) , whose goes by both " elise " and " sharon . " 
pos/cv747_16556.txt as the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises , the question of martial law is raised . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt enter general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who opposes martial law at first but who , as soon as the president decides to send in the army , begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt hub listens as devereaux tortures and murders a suspect . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt the future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt what would happen , they ask , if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut and belfast ? 
pos/cv747_16556.txt what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns ? 
pos/cv747_16556.txt these questions " the siege " answers in realistic detail . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt it implies tougher ones , though : what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom ? 
pos/cv747_16556.txt if we encourage terrorism abroad ( from bening's character we discover that the cia trained the bombers ) , will it inevitably come back to us ? 
pos/cv747_16556.txt  " siege " avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero , hub , with a uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought-provoking issues the movie raises . 
pos/cv747_16556.txt still , zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies ( willis' " die hard " series , for example ) offer only a comic-book view on terrorism .

pos/cv252_23779.txt no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt all recipes are fictions . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
pos/cv252_23779.txt director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt  " . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . " 
pos/cv252_23779.txt this true story , briefly mentioned in " the shining " , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a " hero " and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt in ways he could never have imagined . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously " over-medicated " cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the two main characters are also the most interesting . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt colqhoun is different . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the atmosphere in " ravenous " is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt here time stands still , and nothing changes . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the result is some sort of cabin fever . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt cannibalism is more like a sick game for them . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it's like " who's going to die first ? " 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's " the shining " . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it's hard to not get mad here ! 
pos/cv252_23779.txt one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt the director herself stated that it was " ok to laugh " during the picture . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : " . . it's 
pos/cv252_23779.txt lonely being a cannibal . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt you don't get that many friends . . . " 
pos/cv252_23779.txt or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying " eat to live . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt don't live to eat . " ) . but 
pos/cv252_23779.txt mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt every actor does a great job . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt  " ravenous " starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt however these little failures don't diminish the impression . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since " the shining " . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt  " . . i said no food . 
pos/cv252_23779.txt i didn't say there was nothing to eat . . . "

pos/cv999_13106.txt

pos/cv999_13106.txt truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt  " truman " also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt combine all these names and concepts into " truman burbank , " and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt truman leads the perfect life . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt  . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt  . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt two security guards grab him and throw him out . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt truman is really suspicious now . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt  " it's best not to think about it , " she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt his actions are " real " but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt we root for the captive of the cage-world . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt our protagonist is counting on " chaos theory " to help him escape his elaborate trap . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt but on its own terms , the movie is well made . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt much of the first part of the movie is the truman show . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the music is well-chosen and scored . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt  ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) 
pos/cv999_13106.txt and the pacing of the story was brisk . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film " clicked " and became an instant classic . 
pos/cv999_13106.txt nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be . 


pos/cv686_13900.txt

pos/cv686_13900.txt  " the fighting sullivans " contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film , as i knew exactly what was going to happen . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt and that's the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt because of this , i will tread lightly so i don't ruin it for anyone reading this review , and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt  " the fighting sullivans " revolves around a family that consists of a mother , father , sister , and five brothers . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt the brothers are very close , despite the occasional disagreement . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt they are inseperable , and never stray from one another . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children , and their various adventures . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt when four of them get into a fight with some local boys , the youngest sullivan , who is inside a church at the time , comes running out to assist , but not before properly exiting the chapel . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt if i'm being awfully vague about details , it's because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt all i can say is go watch this film , because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together , through the good and the bad . 
pos/cv686_13900.txt and after you see the movie , you will understand why this review has been written the way it has .

pos/cv941_10246.txt synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver's scheme . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt the film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt it neither stands out nor disappoints . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt like leiter's character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie .

pos/cv941_10246.txt i dont believe in horoscopes . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts ) . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt  " leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity .

pos/cv941_10246.txt in real life , michelle yeoh is asia's top female star . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt like jackie chan , she does her own stunts .

pos/cv941_10246.txt her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . 
pos/cv941_10246.txt of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , " wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . " 
pos/cv941_10246.txt my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice .

pos/cv612_5461.txt in the wake of the smashing success of " rumble in the bronx , " it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of " period-piece " martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt surprised ? 
pos/cv612_5461.txt well , so was i . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the " once upon a time in china " movies , but i have not yet seen those . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of " war and peace " . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt and so it goes . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the 
pos/cv612_5461.txt action . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of 
pos/cv612_5461.txt course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the primary martial arts " style " featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but 
pos/cv612_5461.txt there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt  ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) 
pos/cv612_5461.txt unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( " a better tomorrow " 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the " heroic trio " series , " rumble in the bronx " ) . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the picture is crisp and clear . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt  ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) 
pos/cv612_5461.txt it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt drunken master ii shows the full potential of " period piece " kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . 
pos/cv612_5461.txt if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . 


pos/cv954_18628.txt

pos/cv954_18628.txt eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . 
pos/cv954_18628.txt it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll .

pos/cv874_11236.txt ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt turns out , the city is not on earth at all . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always " used to have big spaceships blow up cities . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt i think we're a little tired of that . " 
pos/cv874_11236.txt according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt it's a philosophical piece . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt what is the human condition ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt what is ethical ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt what would a true human being do ? 
pos/cv874_11236.txt far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . 
pos/cv874_11236.txt in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , " because the human condition isn't located in here . " 


pos/cv781_5262.txt

pos/cv781_5262.txt robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt 1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt  ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) 
pos/cv781_5262.txt after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt recruits his remains for their new " robocop " program . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt 1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? 
pos/cv781_5262.txt the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . 
pos/cv781_5262.txt however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .
