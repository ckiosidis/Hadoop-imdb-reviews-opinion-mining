neg/cv382_8393.txt possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt it smashed u . s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt but is it any good ? 
neg/cv382_8393.txt in a word , no . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt i'll elaborate further . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt the story is as follows . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt  ( see jurrasic park . ) 
neg/cv382_8393.txt imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt so , basically , what you have is this . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt it's crap . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? ' 
neg/cv382_8393.txt  ( yes , you should ) . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt it's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c . g . i 
neg/cv382_8393.txt dinosaurs ( the t . rex's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world . 
neg/cv382_8393.txt a very dissapointing sequel , indeed .

neg/cv163_10110.txt his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he's left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt she's giving him one more chance . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt he blows that chance when he invents " flubber " ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself .

neg/cv163_10110.txt at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked " why are these people laughing ? " 
neg/cv163_10110.txt although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt everyone else comes across as half-asleep . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt the re-make is successful in that respect . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt there have been some updates .

neg/cv163_10110.txt his faithful dog charlie is now " weebo " , the hovering robot .

neg/cv163_10110.txt the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt it's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding .

neg/cv163_10110.txt in some ways , it's difficult to judge this film . 
neg/cv163_10110.txt i have a suspicion that i'm not it's target audience .

neg/cv750_10606.txt

neg/cv750_10606.txt disney's " air bud " tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt granted , for a family comedy , it's not a very funny or successful idea to begin with , but it doesn't seem to matter -- " air bud " is surprisingly solemn . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt save for occasional moments of forced slapstick , the movie wags its tale with a straight face -- not a very enjoyable approach . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt if " air bud " had realized its own absurdity , then it possibly could have been better . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt here , we're actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marches out to save the big game , clad in two pairs of sneakers and even a jersey . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt its number ? 
neg/cv750_10606.txt k9 . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt yeah , whatever . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt the movie opens as golden retriever buddy ( as himself ) escapes from his current owner , abusive clown-for-hire norm snively ( michael jeter ) . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt he ends up in fernwell , washington , where mopey new-kid-on-the-block josh ( kevin zegers ) is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt buddy , kevin . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt kevin , buddy . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt once the dog proves his on-court prowess , kevin's self-esteem rockets . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt they both win places in the school's basketball team , with the animal as their mascot . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt but before they can make it to the finals , snively surfaces to reclaim buddy . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt everything plays out just as one would think : heavy on predictability , light on an actual story . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt the movie follows a calculated chain of events -- kevin's gloom fades , snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller-style . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt okay , that last one's a lie , but at least it would have been a quicker send-off than " air bud " 's courtroom climax -- no joke ! 
neg/cv750_10606.txt there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to " splish splash . " 
neg/cv750_10606.txt paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried , all in the name of formula . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt the end credits note that " no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture . " 
neg/cv750_10606.txt that very well may be true , and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight , a movie cannot exist on feat alone . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt but " air bud " doesn't seem to be interested in anything else . 
neg/cv750_10606.txt a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david letterman's " stupid pet tricks . " 
neg/cv750_10606.txt i can't think of a more appropriate connection -- this movie is a stupid pet trick . 


neg/cv818_10698.txt

neg/cv818_10698.txt ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities , " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power . " 
neg/cv818_10698.txt but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- " scary " ( melanie brown ) , " baby " ( emma bunton ) , " sporty " ( melanie chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwell ) , and " posh " ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit " say you'll be there , " a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? 
neg/cv818_10698.txt wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the " wacky " goings-on . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra " --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt ha ha . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being " ginger " or " scary " ? 
neg/cv818_10698.txt apparently , just their wardrobes . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , " wannabe . " 
neg/cv818_10698.txt the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . 
neg/cv818_10698.txt once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .

neg/cv288_20212.txt the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt my vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man's wife . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who's acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993's philadelphia , than that of a warrior . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt in the film's supposed pay off scene , he exclaims " i was wrong , these are not men ! " , 
neg/cv288_20212.txt a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt unfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase's career look like oscar material . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt the film , based on michael crichton's best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt at the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt questions like " why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? " , 
neg/cv288_20212.txt  " why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? " 
neg/cv288_20212.txt and finally , " will the manager give me a refund ? " 
neg/cv288_20212.txt 90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors " come with me , there is a woman who can help . " 
neg/cv288_20212.txt unfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film . 
neg/cv288_20212.txt the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of " springtime for hitler . "

neg/cv961_5578.txt barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , " don't call me babe , " sound very ironic indeed . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of " barb wire . " 
neg/cv961_5578.txt if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? 
neg/cv961_5578.txt only a stuntwoman . 
neg/cv961_5578.txt not pamela anderson lee . 


neg/cv023_13847.txt

neg/cv023_13847.txt  " snake eyes " is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it's worse than that . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt in certain circles , " snake eyes " was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic " rashomon , " where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and 
neg/cv023_13847.txt discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it takes one wrong step . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt what went wrong ? 
neg/cv023_13847.txt depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , " blow out , " where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt at least his direction makes up partly for it . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt then there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier " carlito's way , " a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt he's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt now there's a film . 
neg/cv023_13847.txt unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .

neg/cv853_29119.txt it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt not that there's anything wrong with scatology . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he doesn't look fluish . " 
neg/cv853_29119.txt and the jokes don't rise above that level . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the live action scenes are no better . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt it lacks scope and depth . 
neg/cv853_29119.txt it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater . 


neg/cv075_6250.txt

neg/cv075_6250.txt it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt but this does not save a misguided script . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt but wallace's actions paint a different story . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt this is evident of a " spartacus complex " , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . 
neg/cv075_6250.txt this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . 


neg/cv133_18065.txt

neg/cv133_18065.txt here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt he still can't act . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . 
neg/cv133_18065.txt this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par .
