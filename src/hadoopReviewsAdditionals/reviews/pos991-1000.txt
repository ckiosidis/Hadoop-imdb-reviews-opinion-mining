pos/cv830_6014.txt for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america's finest actresses . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt that's just the beginning of her troubles . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt anney's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( " when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? 
pos/cv830_6014.txt i'll tell you when - never ! " 
pos/cv830_6014.txt he's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . 
pos/cv830_6014.txt perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing . 


pos/cv550_22211.txt

pos/cv550_22211.txt at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt on second glance it looks that way too . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the " haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? " 
pos/cv550_22211.txt feeling that creeps up all too often during the film . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt  " what disaster is that ? " 
pos/cv550_22211.txt you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt glad you asked . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt sage -- nice name . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt note to sage -- you are still young . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? 
pos/cv550_22211.txt would this be too much to ask ? 
pos/cv550_22211.txt can't we all just get along ? 
pos/cv550_22211.txt special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt they were the best part of the movie by a long shot . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt better than average stallone flick . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger . 
pos/cv550_22211.txt daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren't expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised . 


pos/cv617_9322.txt

pos/cv617_9322.txt there is a scene early in soul food , george tillman's comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis , that caught me completely off guard . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt during a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p . hall , comes to the rescue . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt the way in which she does this makes me think irma p . hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt however , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt vanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt williams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt fox is maxine , the strongest of the sisters , which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad , who narrates the film . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt long is bird , a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt at the center of everything is irma p . hall , as big mama jo . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt every sunday , the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo's house . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt there is lots of conversation , lots of laughs , and the occasional controversy . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt she is stern and disciplined , but also caring and forgiving . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt everything is going fine , until a tragedy befalls mama jo . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt all of a sudden , a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt it gets so bad , sunday dinner is even cancelled . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt without mama jo's guidance , there is noone to keep the family together , which frustrates ahmad . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt miles and maxine's marriage begins to fall apart , as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt lem's temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt and teri tries to prevent maxine's efforts to sell mama jo's house . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt the third act of the film deals with ahmad's attempts to patch things up . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt he decides to take over where mama jo left off , and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding , with special notices to irma p . hall and brandon hammond . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth , and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt the dialogue is beleiveable and funny . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt and then there's the food . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food , and it indeed looks very tasty . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family . 
pos/cv617_9322.txt soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year .

pos/cv085_1381.txt  * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * * 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt and i liked each film separately for which it was . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt now alien 3 is out . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this vessel crash lands on fury 109 . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt yes , after 57 years ripley has sex . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt there is a lot more gore in alien 3 . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
pos/cv085_1381.txt i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the rest of the cast is also quite good . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt alien 3 has a very distinct look . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this is due largely to its director , david fincher . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt this is a great score . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt the ending to alien 3 is quite good . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt i will not ruin the ending for you . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt go see the film . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . 
pos/cv085_1381.txt and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . 


pos/cv720_5389.txt

pos/cv720_5389.txt it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like " wheel of fish " and movies like " conan , the librarian . " 
pos/cv720_5389.txt as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt as r . j . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt for every gag that works , at least one fizzles . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt for instance , weird al's mock video of " money for nothing " by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt well , since airplane . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt much of the credit goes to weird al's exceptionally inventive script and to the movie's winsome cast . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he's not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt the real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children's show : " stanley spadowski's playhouse . " 
pos/cv720_5389.txt stanley's off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt he is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt and above all , he's a good janitor who adores his work . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt the cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , " wheel of fish . " 
pos/cv720_5389.txt also aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62's roving reporter . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt unfortunately , as weird al's girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt while uhf is not an absolute must-see , it's definitely the ticket if you're looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy . 
pos/cv720_5389.txt the movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun . 


pos/cv772_12119.txt

pos/cv772_12119.txt true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get " the apostle " onto the big-screen . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss " sonny " dewey . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt re-christening himself as " the apostle e . f . , " he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt duvall has made his intentions in making " the apostle " clear . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt in a recent article in " newsweek , " he wrote : " filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . " 
pos/cv772_12119.txt the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - " the apostle " always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt  " i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , " he says . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt the main theme to emerge from " the apostle " is the fact that good can come from any situation . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt as a director , duvall feels that less is more . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt duvall knew that the power of the film's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn't need to be artificially enhanced . 
pos/cv772_12119.txt in this way , " the apostle " almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . 


pos/cv753_10875.txt

pos/cv753_10875.txt naturally , at the core of leon gast's " when we were kings " is the fight itself , for what a fight it was . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt but " when we were kings " tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast's film with a forceful swipe at the united states . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt when ali hollers " damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : " no viet cong ever called me nigger " , ali reasons . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of " when we were kings " is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt listening to the film's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this " rumble in the jungle " is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a " coming home " to africa . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt foreman reminds us that africa is the " cradle of civilisation " . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt while ali respects mobutu's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt mailer's insights are lost on most of the film's commentators . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire' s squalid ruling elite . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the " messiah " label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt he may be , as one sympathiser notes , " blacker " than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali's opponent wasn't white . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt there is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt the excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt and of course there's always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - " we gonna get it on coz we don't get along ! " . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt doubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of " when we were kings " faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . 
pos/cv753_10875.txt fortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event .

pos/cv086_18371.txt are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? 
pos/cv086_18371.txt wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt everyweek , wafflemovies . com 
pos/cv086_18371.txt reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt here is a sample review : 
pos/cv086_18371.txt welcome to sarajevo 
pos/cv086_18371.txt in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 
pos/cv086_18371.txt the movie was beautifully and sensitively made . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com 
pos/cv086_18371.txt selection mad city . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt war is a foreign concept to most of us in america . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . 
pos/cv086_18371.txt this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . 


pos/cv763_14729.txt

pos/cv763_14729.txt your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people , who hop in and out of bed with each other . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt written and directed by neil labute , who's first film , " in the company of men " was simply marvelous , disappoints a bit here with this one . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt the story involves two couples ( ben stiller & catherine keener and aaron eckhart & amy brenneman ) , an artist assistant ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotistical women abuser ( jason patric ) . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt the character's names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt each of the characters has their own sexual style and they don't seem to " merge " together well . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt so the group experiments behind their respective partners back . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt there are some hysterical scenes , one involves jason patric , aaron eckhart , and ben stiller's characters . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt they are all in a sauna , talking about their best " lay " , when jason patric's character makes a surprising confession . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt the enjoyed this movie , although it seemed a tad lengthy ( even though it only runs 99 min . ) . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt the film's cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener , aaron eckhart , and jason patric . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt i would not recommend this film , to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt it did seem to offend people , more than half of the people in the theater left during the film . 
pos/cv763_14729.txt although your friends and neighbors doesn't have the power of labute's earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny , while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships . 


pos/cv178_12972.txt

pos/cv178_12972.txt i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial " eat me " scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt but weird things start happening . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt he's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt most fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt and when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt but merge the two and you've got the truman show . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt right now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ? 
pos/cv178_12972.txt one day , though , it could happen . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . 
pos/cv178_12972.txt you know they would .
