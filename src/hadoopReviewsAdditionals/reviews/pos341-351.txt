pos/cv673_24714.txt in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt the only possible solution i can muster is its release date . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt and not just the timeliness of the " greed is good " subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
pos/cv673_24714.txt in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it " all " . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it " all " the easy way . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt i know this story . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt we all do . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt his style is sitcom bland . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt but his writing isn't . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt diesl shines in his minor role . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt nia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt the two make an oddly likeable couple . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt at one point he says to her " i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love " . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt that message being , " greed is bad " . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt yes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt boiler room offers neither extreme . 
pos/cv673_24714.txt it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . 


pos/cv586_7543.txt

pos/cv586_7543.txt [note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt as it happens , it didn't take long . ] 
pos/cv586_7543.txt is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? 
pos/cv586_7543.txt known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? 
pos/cv586_7543.txt what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a " lethal weapon " ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? 
pos/cv586_7543.txt franco zeffirelli , that's who . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt  ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help . ) 
pos/cv586_7543.txt alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare " this is important ; this is shakespeare ! " 
pos/cv586_7543.txt i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare " definitive . " 
pos/cv586_7543.txt and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . 
pos/cv586_7543.txt but if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . 


pos/cv624_10744.txt

pos/cv624_10744.txt  " i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , " earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss " sonny " dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt rarely has a movie been such a labor of love . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt duvall has every movement down pat . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt he dances and claps all the way . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt  " i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , " he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt and they lap it up . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt people jump up , scream , " praise the lord ! " 
pos/cv624_10744.txt and mean it . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt but sonny is no saint . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( " one way road to heaven : holiness temple " ) with an enthusiastic flock . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , " i quit school because i didn't like recess . " 
pos/cv624_10744.txt in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . 
pos/cv624_10744.txt it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . 


pos/cv873_18636.txt

pos/cv873_18636.txt in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt if there were ever a clear case for " less is more , " this would be it . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , " well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it . " 
pos/cv873_18636.txt great stuff . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying " eight months later , " michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt it's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . 
pos/cv873_18636.txt for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?

pos/cv361_28944.txt susan granger's review of " songcatcher " in the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes , there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt oscar nominee janet mcteer ( " tumbleweeds " ) stars as dr . lily penleric , an accomplished musicologist who , back in that pre-feminist era , was refused a full professorship at her university . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt determined to prove her worth , she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina , where her younger sister elna ( jane adams ) runs a school . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt there in bear creek , she discovers a treasure-trove of traditional scots-irish and english folk ballads , given a unique interpretation by the insular locals . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt excited , she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler ( pat carroll ) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt their music , as she puts it , is " as much a part of life here as the air you breathe . " 
pos/cv361_28944.txt that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt ornery , bearded , banjo-picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque , passionate " songcatcher , " while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague ( e .

pos/cv361_28944.txt i'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris , iris dement , taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer's wide-eyed prot ? g ? . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt rated pg-13 , there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth . 
pos/cv361_28944.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " songcatcher " is an intelligent , extraordinary 8 , transported by the transcendent power of song .

pos/cv822_20049.txt after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? 
pos/cv822_20049.txt you've got to commend the acting . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the acting is the glue that holds everything together . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt in fact , she's flat-out great . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt which is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt but oh well . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . 
pos/cv822_20049.txt let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us . 


pos/cv882_10026.txt

pos/cv882_10026.txt airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! 
pos/cv882_10026.txt remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt  . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt  . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt it had to do with bad fish . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt in the midst of it all , something happens . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt someone gets sick . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt then another . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt then another . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt  . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt  . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? 
pos/cv882_10026.txt  ( gee , i wonder ) 
pos/cv882_10026.txt of course the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt he's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt in a film like this , you're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can't complain about the amateurish quality . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt i don't know why he was put in there , and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt aside from that , airplane ! 
pos/cv882_10026.txt is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven't seen it . 
pos/cv882_10026.txt and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em " it's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that's not important right now . " 
pos/cv882_10026.txt if you've seen the film , you'll understand ; - ) 


pos/cv610_2287.txt

pos/cv610_2287.txt one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , " guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back . " 
pos/cv610_2287.txt fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some " naked indian guy , " an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you'll find out here . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt garth has somewhat of a " coming of age " and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne's world . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt the plot is flimsy but manageable . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn't even think about looking at my watch a single time . 
pos/cv610_2287.txt silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original . 


pos/cv621_14368.txt

pos/cv621_14368.txt ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
pos/cv621_14368.txt you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , " welcome back kotter . " 
pos/cv621_14368.txt always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt  " so , " you ask , " where is he now ? " 
pos/cv621_14368.txt mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt that's right . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt you silly goose . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt sorry about the segue , or lack thereof . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt  " i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , " says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt wait ! 
pos/cv621_14368.txt as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt hang on ! 
pos/cv621_14368.txt packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt okay , i guess that's enough . 
pos/cv621_14368.txt oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .

pos/cv063_28997.txt susan granger's review of " the closet " ( miramax films ) 
pos/cv063_28997.txt in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt but not everyone is enchanted . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . 
pos/cv063_28997.txt it's so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles . "
