neg/cv176_14196.txt not just any action sequence would do .

neg/cv176_14196.txt any film that could take the indie-films' most valuable talents , and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle , a hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o sets and lousy special effects , is , bottom line , living proof that hell exists , and has made a multi-picture deal with universal . 
neg/cv176_14196.txt in the midst of all the action , the terseness , the one-liners , the fake sets , the overall waste of time , i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician ( " malloy , give me a reading " ) . 
neg/cv176_14196.txt remember him ? 
neg/cv176_14196.txt he was a principal player in last year's _in the company of men_ , a film that was more powerful , shocking , terrifying , funny , and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be . 
neg/cv176_14196.txt _armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make . 
neg/cv176_14196.txt _itcom_ cost a paltry $30 , 000 . 
neg/cv176_14196.txt need i say more ?

neg/cv588_14467.txt perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt  ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) 
neg/cv588_14467.txt with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt  " the show is over for this fella , " steve buscemi's character says towards the end . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt the impostors runs 1 : 42 . 
neg/cv588_14467.txt it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 


neg/cv503_11196.txt

neg/cv503_11196.txt michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt hoffman's acting seems muted . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt jackson seems to laid back . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a 
neg/cv503_11196.txt cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt levinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium . 
neg/cv503_11196.txt the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv315_12638.txt

neg/cv315_12638.txt synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the " spider-man " titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt mcfarlane's " spawn " immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt the early " spawn " issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt with the popularity of " spawn " and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt what happened ? 
neg/cv315_12638.txt why is spawn so bad ? 
neg/cv315_12638.txt todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that " how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , " as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt to be fair , however , marilyn manson's " long hard road out of hell " effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's " ( can't you ) trip like i do " proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt for as good a comic book as it is , " spawn " did not spawn a good movie . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . 
neg/cv315_12638.txt rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young .

neg/cv190_27176.txt gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt it's just a pile of dreck . . . an 
neg/cv190_27176.txt ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt  " end of days " aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which 
neg/cv190_27176.txt makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a 
neg/cv190_27176.txt big-budget slasher film . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : " even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil . " 
neg/cv190_27176.txt we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body .

neg/cv190_27176.txt he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number " 666 , '' well ! 
neg/cv190_27176.txt  . . . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt satan's numeral is actually " 999 , '' which is upside down of " 666 . '' 
neg/cv190_27176.txt accordingly , you just put a " 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get " 1999 . '' 
neg/cv190_27176.txt with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . 
neg/cv190_27176.txt i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose .

neg/cv017_23487.txt so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? 
neg/cv017_23487.txt well , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! 
neg/cv017_23487.txt it's like i said . . . this 
neg/cv017_23487.txt movie sucks . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt uneven , would be another . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go " somewhere " . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the " pain " of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt in a sci-fi movie ? 
neg/cv017_23487.txt well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their " misadventures in space " for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt ugh . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt what a friggin' mess . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? 
neg/cv017_23487.txt didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! ) . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt 'nuff said . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my 
neg/cv017_23487.txt ears hurt ! ) . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt so is anything salvageable in this movie ? 
neg/cv017_23487.txt sure . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the " sand-twister " effect that you see in the commercial is well done . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt other than that ? 
neg/cv017_23487.txt i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , 
neg/cv017_23487.txt did i say " admire " , i meant " am disgusted " ! 
neg/cv017_23487.txt all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . 
neg/cv017_23487.txt go see the ninth gate . . . now 
neg/cv017_23487.txt there's a great movie ! 
neg/cv017_23487.txt and on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .

neg/cv482_11233.txt even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the best word to describe this film is " asinine . " 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a " lost tribe " somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the " shelmikedmu " . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt the acting in underwhelming . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt dreyfuss has definitely not given his " all " to the role of james krippendorf . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt if there's any upside , it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . 
neg/cv482_11233.txt krippendorf's tribe will quickly become extinct . 


neg/cv707_11421.txt

neg/cv707_11421.txt one of the 90s' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it's the " ___ from hell " movie ! 
neg/cv707_11421.txt starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! 
neg/cv707_11421.txt there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! ! 
neg/cv707_11421.txt the mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt she has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt but those intentions are about to change . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt you see , martha lives by manipulation . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha's web of deception . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt it's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha' schemes . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's likely to question details . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt jessica lange's martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt gwyneth paltrow doesn't have much to build upon , as helen's only character trait seems to be " daughter-in-law " . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt still , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he's inexplicably missing for much of the film . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt still , there have been much worse " ____ from hell " films . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt even with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt you know what's coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two . 
neg/cv707_11421.txt the old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn't mean they taste fresh . 


neg/cv063_28852.txt

neg/cv063_28852.txt would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? 
neg/cv063_28852.txt let me tell you what reality is . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt that's reality . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt  ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) 
neg/cv063_28852.txt and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? 
neg/cv063_28852.txt and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? 
neg/cv063_28852.txt oh billy , you're a scamp ! 
neg/cv063_28852.txt the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? 
neg/cv063_28852.txt and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! 
neg/cv063_28852.txt if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt it's about to expire . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , 
neg/cv063_28852.txt america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt bad move , billy -- your jokes suck . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt it'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt i could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . 
neg/cv063_28852.txt when you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? 


neg/cv141_17179.txt

neg/cv141_17179.txt writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) 
neg/cv141_17179.txt starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso 
neg/cv141_17179.txt i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter's twisted remake of " the thing . " 
neg/cv141_17179.txt  " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt they get on . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt they break up into pairs and investigate . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo 'em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt or peter o'toole in " caligula . " 
neg/cv141_17179.txt great actor , horrific performance . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt  " virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . " 
neg/cv141_17179.txt and if you don't believe me , go back and rent " godzilla , " and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt but all of this doesn't matter since " virus " is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt imagine the first attack of the aliens in " aliens , " shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of " virus " : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt and my god , it's a long damn sit . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like " out of sight " and " saving private ryan " give you more faith in them , but movies like " virus " manage to drain a little more out of the pool . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . 
neg/cv141_17179.txt in fact , shouts of " egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? " 
neg/cv141_17179.txt are not only justifiable , but encouraged .
