neg/cv695_22268.txt house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , 
neg/cv695_22268.txt  " house on haunted hill " initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt  " house on haunted hill " doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt  " house on haunted hill " , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the problem is that every character is not likable . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt the main problem is that " house on haunted hill " is not scary . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . 
neg/cv695_22268.txt if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to " deep blue sea " ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed .

neg/cv426_10976.txt  " deep rising " gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's " anaconda " -- " deep rising " has no tongue to put in its cheek . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen " titanic , " then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt the main problem with " deep rising " is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt the concept is " leviathan " meets " titanic , " with a dash of " speed 2 " thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) 
neg/cv426_10976.txt measure . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt this monster is equal parts " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " and " the relic , " knows how to open doors like the raptors from " jurassic park " and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in " anaconda . " 
neg/cv426_10976.txt some of the attack sequences are straight out of " jaws " and " alien . " 
neg/cv426_10976.txt a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of " alien resurrection . " 
neg/cv426_10976.txt there's even a jet ski chase like " hard rain . " 
neg/cv426_10976.txt and the list goes on . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt watching " deep rising " 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as " goldeneye " 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's " amistad , " pops up in a brief part . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt he needs to stay away from the water . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt the movie's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you're really asking for it ) , " deep rising " is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . 
neg/cv426_10976.txt and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question .

neg/cv607_8235.txt i feel sorry for the financial backers of " waterworld , " which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) , and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off ! 
neg/cv607_8235.txt in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt it's not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well , it is that too ) , it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt he's referred to as the mariner , but they " the meaner " would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold , rigid , and strict - and he's supposed the be the good guy ! 
neg/cv607_8235.txt he docks at a small floating village of sorts . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes ! 
neg/cv607_8235.txt how are these things powered ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt and if they have airplanes , couldn't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt i'm sorry , i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt it doesn't make any sense . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to " dryland . " 
neg/cv607_8235.txt who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ? 
neg/cv607_8235.txt we never get an answer , just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt to make a long , boring , stupid , and just plain bad story short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt they sail for a long time , encountering some strange people in the process and fight off " the smokers " as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper ) , who kidnaps enola . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons , rescuing enola , and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt even with all its special effects , action , and adventure this film is boring . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt not a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson's joker , while costner just plain rips . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt still , " waterworld " is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it . 
neg/cv607_8235.txt i just hope they don't make a sequel !

neg/cv038_9781.txt capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? 
neg/cv038_9781.txt starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt why am i calling this movie pornography ? 
neg/cv038_9781.txt pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do 'er , man , do 'er ! " 
neg/cv038_9781.txt that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt  ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? 
neg/cv038_9781.txt hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt once or twice is fine . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt there's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt uh-huh . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt i say " quasi- " because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt like the rest of the movie . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt there's more , i suppose , but it's not worth it . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . 
neg/cv038_9781.txt the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . 


neg/cv115_26443.txt

neg/cv115_26443.txt forget get carter . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt instead . . . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt get me a cup of coffee . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? 
neg/cv115_26443.txt did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? 
neg/cv115_26443.txt when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt get carter is a simple story . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter's way " . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt what a minute ! 
neg/cv115_26443.txt this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . 
neg/cv115_26443.txt never mind that it should never have been made at all . 


neg/cv531_26838.txt

neg/cv531_26838.txt i have never been so confused after watching a movie . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt  " meet joe black " is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what's going on , you'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? 
neg/cv531_26838.txt the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it feels like an eternity . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and " meaningful " winks . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt the film is based on alberto caesella's play " death takes a holiday " . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying " yes " . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as " death " . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it is bill's time . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt but death has other plans . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt our bill is chosen to be death's guide and in exchange he gets time . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone's attention . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side , lives in his house and resides at his office . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt that is not all , however . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill's family for dinner . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it's one thing to say : " wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . " 
neg/cv531_26838.txt to create a motion picture out of this is another . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( " scent of a woman " ) . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt how can you play death in human form ? 
neg/cv531_26838.txt to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt they are not creatures , but phenomenas . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt in other words this is not what i expected from the director of " scent of a woman " . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt it could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . 
neg/cv531_26838.txt in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera . 


neg/cv944_15042.txt

neg/cv944_15042.txt  " it was not scary . " 
neg/cv944_15042.txt these are the first words that came to mind after it was over . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt when a movie is called _vampires_ , " not scary " aren't words that should be associated with it . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt but that wasn't my only gripe . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt unfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt to commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt their celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt upham in _saving private ryan_ . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt _vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt but it's too little too late . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt we get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we're dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) 
neg/cv944_15042.txt interestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt woods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt and his motive for killing vampires ? 
neg/cv944_15042.txt take a wild guess . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt  ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) 
neg/cv944_15042.txt at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt to make up for this , the movie resorts to other " shocks , " such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to " getting woodies . " ) 
neg/cv944_15042.txt it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt if not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt _john carpenter's vampires_ is none of these . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . 
neg/cv944_15042.txt for the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth . 


neg/cv221_27081.txt

neg/cv221_27081.txt it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix , " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( " kiss the girls , " " se7en " ) . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the result should have been more interesting than " the cell . " 
neg/cv221_27081.txt as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the focus of " the cell " in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt for the most part , it's style without substance . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's " losing my religion , " and " the cell " seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the premise had great promise . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt like sidney lumet's " the offence " or michael mann's " manhunter , " " the cell " could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role . 
neg/cv221_27081.txt bottom line : don't get trapped in this one . 


neg/cv294_12695.txt

neg/cv294_12695.txt in this re-make of the 1954 japanese monster film , godzilla is transformed into a " jurassic park " copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while , it gets old fast . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt the film often makes no sense ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , sports second-rate effects ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , lame jokes ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny ) , horrendous acting ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an unbelievable love story ( why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo's character ? ) . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt there are other elements of the film that fall flat , but going on would just be a waste of good words . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt only for die-hard creature feature fans , this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt i couldn't . 
neg/cv294_12695.txt  ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both " fear and loathing " and " godzilla " in the same evening . )

neg/cv782_21078.txt in " the 13th warrior , " arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king's old lady . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt with his translator ( screen legend omar sharif in a small role ) , ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen ( vikings ) . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt thus , ahmed becomes the " 13th warrior . " 
neg/cv782_21078.txt on the trip , ahmed manages to learn the vikings' language by listening to their fireside conversations . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt a bit far-fetched , it's true , but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt ahmed , who's called " ibn " by the vikings , forms friendships with herger the joyous ( dennis storh ? i ) and the viking leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich ) . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt when they arrive in the other kingdom , the thirteen warriors discover that they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt hereafter , most of the movie is battle scenes : the cannibals attack the vikings , the vikings attack the cannibals , the cannibals attack the . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt  . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt  . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt well , you get the idea . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt just to add some action , there's also a viking vs . viking duel . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt other movies insert scenes between the fights ; these scenes are called character development . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt i suspect that " the 13th warrior " had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team direction . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan ( you'll notice a lot of similarities between " warrior " and mctiernan's " predator , " including the chittering jungle sounds ) . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt somewhere along the line , mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt crichton , whose novel " eaters of the dead " is the basis for " warrior , " has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction " thrillers " : " westworld , " " coma , " " looker , " " runaway . " 
neg/cv782_21078.txt their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt perhaps what " the 13th warrior " needs more than anything else is a villain . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt the " eaters of the dead " are a faceless mob in blackface . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt they have no personality , and by the end they don't even seem particularly threatening . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain ; it was his " die hard " that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil roles in action films . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt  " the 13th warrior " suffers from a lack of vision . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt it wants to be " predator " meets " braveheart " meets " the magnificent seven " meets " dances with wolves . " 
neg/cv782_21078.txt with so many competing goals , all it can do is echo what it might have been . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt it might have been a satisfying action film . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt it might have been a beautifully-rendered medieval epic . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt it might have been a thought-provoking examination of the meeting of cultures . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular . 
neg/cv782_21078.txt bottom line : if you want to see antonio swing his sword , rent " the mask of zorro . "
