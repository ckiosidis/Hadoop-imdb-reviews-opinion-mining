pos/cv483_16378.txt earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt every viewer is sure to like both of them . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . 
pos/cv483_16378.txt indeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss .

pos/cv023_12672.txt when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  " you mean , " one lady asks , " the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? " ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  " well , " he shouts , laughing , " isn't that obvious ? " 
pos/cv023_12672.txt the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense " truth in politics " methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt  ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . 
pos/cv023_12672.txt is bulworth offensive ? ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt i suppose some may see it that way . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? 
pos/cv023_12672.txt bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? 


pos/cv401_12605.txt

pos/cv401_12605.txt _in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt well , yes ? and no . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
pos/cv401_12605.txt so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt did i ? yes and no . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt mainly yes , i'm happy to say . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt  : - ) ) . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt does it work here ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt which leads us to the second half of the film . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt we all knew it was coming . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt and it is an hour . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt not that i'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt is it overdone ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i thought so . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt haven't mentioned the script . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's a period drama . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! " 
pos/cv401_12605.txt back in the turn of the century ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i doubt it . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ? " . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i doubt it . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt is such dialogue as " i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now " not just a bit ? clumsy ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt yes it is . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt stick with directing , dude . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt after all , they were throwing oscars at " titanic " left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt  ; - ) 
pos/cv401_12605.txt i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! 
pos/cv401_12605.txt just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt hell , don't talk to me about oscars . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt bloomin' farce . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it was deserving in a number of departments , though . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? 
pos/cv401_12605.txt nope , i don't think so . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . 
pos/cv401_12605.txt and as for the fact they're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you ! 


pos/cv407_22637.txt

pos/cv407_22637.txt i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to " saving private ryan " in my opinion ) . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the only problems come during the first and third acts . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt malick takes a little too long to get the film started . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the performances are phenominal all around . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt as to how it stacks up to " saving private ryan " - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , " ryan " was my first . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would " the thin red line " above " ryan ) . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt all in all , " the thin red line " is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt it's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . 
pos/cv407_22637.txt it's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don't come along very often .

pos/cv448_14695.txt the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti-apartheid drama " a world apart " ( 1987/88 ) . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt and maybe , " second best " is even a greater picture . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt this precise , richly detailed , sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt the supporting cast is also fine ( especially jane horrocks as debbie , a social worker who is charged to examine graham's living circumstances ) . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt  " second best " is an underestimated masterpiece . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt it's a pity that films like this one are made so seldom . 
pos/cv448_14695.txt i eagerly await menges' next directorial work , " the lost son " , which will star daniel auteuil .

pos/cv447_27332.txt what is a scary movie anyhow ? 
pos/cv447_27332.txt is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? 
pos/cv447_27332.txt is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? 
pos/cv447_27332.txt possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt movies like " halloween " and " psycho " which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled " the exorcist " , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 " the exorcist " comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt now we get to the experience " the exorcist " the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is " the exorcist " nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in " requiem for a dream " to which she is getting rave reviews for . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! 
pos/cv447_27332.txt anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . 
pos/cv447_27332.txt hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

pos/cv902_12256.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt  ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . ) 
pos/cv902_12256.txt double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to " get [his] shit together " is disquieting in its resonance . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt while mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt  " i'm an actor , " he tells them at one point , using the ol' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . 
pos/cv902_12256.txt  " actors lie . " 
pos/cv902_12256.txt but not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . 


pos/cv185_28654.txt

pos/cv185_28654.txt plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt critique : very cool ! 
pos/cv185_28654.txt now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight ! 
pos/cv185_28654.txt the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain " cute " chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt he is pure evil . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt what a great , great monster ! 
pos/cv185_28654.txt my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole " kiss of the dragon " thing to him and he cut him off by saying " kiss my ass ! " 
pos/cv185_28654.txt pure action movie poetry . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his " acting " pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i 
pos/cv185_28654.txt say again . . . no 
pos/cv185_28654.txt wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt but was i entertained ? 
pos/cv185_28654.txt thoroughly . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ? 
pos/cv185_28654.txt yes , again . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt does this sound interesting to you ? 
pos/cv185_28654.txt well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences . 
pos/cv185_28654.txt all in all , a rippin' , roarin' fun time ! 
pos/cv185_28654.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv185_28654.txt black mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 ) 


pos/cv817_4041.txt

pos/cv817_4041.txt showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt  ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) 
pos/cv817_4041.txt many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of " stardom . " 
pos/cv817_4041.txt the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . 
pos/cv817_4041.txt on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person .
