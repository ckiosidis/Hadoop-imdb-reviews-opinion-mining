pos/cv997_5046.txt glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt like private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt it makes your blood boil . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him " snow flake . " 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of " thirtysomething " ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt in one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . 
pos/cv997_5046.txt like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . 


pos/cv264_12801.txt

pos/cv264_12801.txt the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt but after diasappointing films such as " godzilla " and " fear and loathing in las vegas " , it would be nice to see a really good film . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt but i doubt you could have expected this . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the " decade's best " list . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , " yes , that's what makes this film great . " 
pos/cv264_12801.txt the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt carrey has made a very wise choice . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt truman burbank was born to an audience of millions . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt but he is the only person that is not aware of it . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt the classification of the truman show may be tricky . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ? 
pos/cv264_12801.txt a drama ? 
pos/cv264_12801.txt it really depends on the audience . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism . 
pos/cv264_12801.txt oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less . 


pos/cv364_12901.txt

pos/cv364_12901.txt set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff's murder . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt in the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt with the rumpo's past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! 
pos/cv364_12901.txt sid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee's performance is rather poor . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the 'judge' . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt the death count is the highest of any carry on film . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt the songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie's song ) are very impressive . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film . 
pos/cv364_12901.txt not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series .

pos/cv280_8267.txt other footage shows backstage foolishness , and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford . 
pos/cv280_8267.txt the performance of " titties and beer " played in this movie is very entertaining , with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil . 
pos/cv280_8267.txt frank's guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i've ever heard .

pos/cv101_10175.txt after a stylistic detour with mrs . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt until mrs . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt i found equinox , his last pre- mrs . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . 
pos/cv101_10175.txt rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . 


pos/cv784_14394.txt

pos/cv784_14394.txt it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt he works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt we're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt it's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . 
pos/cv784_14394.txt a recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .

pos/cv366_10221.txt everything is clean . " 
pos/cv366_10221.txt these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt everything parallels everything else . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt  " when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt everything is clean . " 
pos/cv366_10221.txt everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? 
pos/cv366_10221.txt all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ? 
pos/cv366_10221.txt you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven't gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt he doesn't seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt he was needed , but perhaps he should've been used more . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt i hate to say that i don't agree , but i don't . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt even so , it is a very good film . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it's art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn't before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . 
pos/cv366_10221.txt perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes .

pos/cv923_11051.txt ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church 
pos/cv923_11051.txt synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt incidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt on the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . 
pos/cv923_11051.txt in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience .

pos/cv931_17563.txt like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt why is this such a good film ? 
pos/cv931_17563.txt there are almost too many reasons to explain . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt the story : court composer salieri ( f . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt we travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt this performance earned him a well deserved oscar . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt he's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt the movie : every element of this movie works . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music ) . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking . 
pos/cv931_17563.txt this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come .
