neg/cv143_21158.txt this is your definitive " hollywood " movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt over money ( how original ) . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt now she has learned about a law titled " double jeopardy " stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt as i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt he was much more of a supporting character . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt i feel this film had alot going for it . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt originality not being an issue . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt i was just left unsatisfied in the long run . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . 
neg/cv143_21158.txt keep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .

neg/cv836_14311.txt brian de palma's snake eyes stars nicolas cage's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt  ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt only the latter is achieved . ) 
neg/cv836_14311.txt cage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn't know when to shut up . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! " 
neg/cv836_14311.txt actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt the film takes itself all too seriously . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt snake eyes runs 1 : 39 . 
neg/cv836_14311.txt it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . 


neg/cv007_4992.txt

neg/cv007_4992.txt that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant is annoying . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt not just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? 
neg/cv007_4992.txt but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? 
neg/cv007_4992.txt nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt why a child psychologist ? 
neg/cv007_4992.txt so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : 
neg/cv007_4992.txt kid : my dad's an asshole . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? 
neg/cv007_4992.txt kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt more like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed " arnie the dinosaur " ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? 
neg/cv007_4992.txt that's my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line " now it's time to take a look at your volvo , " another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt hugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won't leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . 
neg/cv007_4992.txt but at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it .

neg/cv591_24887.txt suicide is pointless , everyone should know that . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt so what's this movie like ? 
neg/cv591_24887.txt you guessed it . . . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt pointless . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt that's what the press materials for the film probably say . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt well as committing suicide . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt is that a joke ? 
neg/cv591_24887.txt is that supposed to be amusing in some way ? 
neg/cv591_24887.txt from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt and while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt as a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt well since eddie and the cruisers ) . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt all we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt what mother doesn't ? 
neg/cv591_24887.txt it's certainly no reason to commit suicide . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt with the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt having family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies . 
neg/cv591_24887.txt so attention film directors . . .

neg/cv911_21695.txt

neg/cv911_21695.txt well there goes another one . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as 
neg/cv911_21695.txt long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt 'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . 
neg/cv911_21695.txt being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers .

neg/cv030_22893.txt play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt the film has no social message like its predecessors . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt 1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt 2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt 3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt 4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt these boring tales only hurt the central plot . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt 5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? 
neg/cv030_22893.txt by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt forty five painful minutes remain . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . 
neg/cv030_22893.txt however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .

neg/cv281_24711.txt the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , " if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right " . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace " sex " with " your mad slasher film " ) . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) " if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh " . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? 
neg/cv281_24711.txt sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt all the better for that elusive crazed killer . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt the film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt i won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt sad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt now that would be scary . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . 
neg/cv281_24711.txt after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered .

neg/cv914_2856.txt woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger , because that's what's required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as--of all things--a psychologist . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude ! 
neg/cv914_2856.txt alas , mickey rourke , we hardly knew ye . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt story opens with a campy kick--willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt she goes splat , he goes ugh , and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt really . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt the good doctor then moves to sunny l . a . , where he rooms with an old college chum ( scott bakula ) , a therapist who's getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt buddy bites it in the second reel ( no surprise there ) and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt for his troubles as therapy man , willis gets to share some cut-from-nc17 love scenes with the lover's jane march while dodging nails , cars , and rattlesnakes . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt why'd it have to be snakes ? 
neg/cv914_2856.txt color of night is the worst movie of the year . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt period . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt forget north , clifford , or , heaven help us , even on deadly ground . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can't help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt for starters , the " group " is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy ? 
neg/cv914_2856.txt playing a prissy obsessive/compulsive , cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif , alone , may set the psychology profession back ten years . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt the plot's a wreck with laughable dialogue , pointless pov shifts , and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt director richard rush , who once helmed freebie and the bean , doesn't seem to mind . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations , he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set-pieces to make the effort almost worth watching . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt his token freeway chase is ok , but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala ( most recently ) fatal analysis . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt acting credits are across-the-board awful . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt willis can be forgiven because he's filming die hard 3 as we speak . 
neg/cv914_2856.txt but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop ?

neg/cv652_15653.txt

neg/cv652_15653.txt  " jack frost , " is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt  " frosty the snowman , " is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn't work at all . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , " jack frost , " quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , " what happens after you die ? " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt or , " how does it feel to be a snowman ? " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? 
neg/cv652_15653.txt i have always liked kelly preston . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , " nothing to lose , " and , " addicted to love . " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : " you da man , " says charlie . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt  " no , i da snowman , " replies jack . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : " snowdad is better than no dad . " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? 
neg/cv652_15653.txt the snowman , created by john henson's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , " jack frost , " but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt as a seasonal holiday picture , " jack frost , " is pretty much a clunker . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt a better christmas film from this year is , " i'll be home for christmas . " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , " it's a wonderful life , " " a christmas story , " or , " prancer . " 
neg/cv652_15653.txt  " jack frost , " is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . 
neg/cv652_15653.txt i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway .
