pos/cv490_17872.txt the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of " leila , " a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt set in modern-day iran , " leila " begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt there are no easy answers to be found within " leila , " a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt maybe because " leila " is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt these " small " moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? 
pos/cv490_17872.txt in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt for all of its strong aspects , " leila " isn't a perfect film . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt despite these minor missteps , " leila " is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . 
pos/cv490_17872.txt it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .

pos/cv799_18543.txt veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt eastwood furrows his brow . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? 
pos/cv799_18543.txt jeter doesn't know what he's talking about . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt eastwood furrows his brow . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star . 
pos/cv799_18543.txt this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .

pos/cv721_29121.txt

pos/cv721_29121.txt it's hard not to recommend " the others . " 
pos/cv721_29121.txt the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( " open your eyes " ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old " twilight zone " episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , " get on with it ! " 
pos/cv721_29121.txt as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in " the others , " my reaction was much the same . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . 
pos/cv721_29121.txt  " the others " sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . 


pos/cv031_18452.txt

pos/cv031_18452.txt you've heard all the hype . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt believe the hype . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt for those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . " 
pos/cv031_18452.txt so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt a lot of the movie is like that . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . " 
pos/cv031_18452.txt furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt well , he's done a good job . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! 
pos/cv031_18452.txt in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt his explanation ? 
pos/cv031_18452.txt  " his future is clouded . " 
pos/cv031_18452.txt  ( warning : major spoiler ahead . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt enter at your own risk . ) 
pos/cv031_18452.txt of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt did this story need to be told ? 
pos/cv031_18452.txt i would say no . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? 
pos/cv031_18452.txt absolutely . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt above all , this is a fun movie . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt but fun . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct . 
pos/cv031_18452.txt because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .

pos/cv420_28795.txt

pos/cv420_28795.txt with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? 
pos/cv420_28795.txt obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , " wow . . . " 
pos/cv420_28795.txt like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien " phantoms . " 
pos/cv420_28795.txt whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a " zeus cannon , " dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a " wave " using eight collected " spirits " to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt why do these aliens feed on souls ? 
pos/cv420_28795.txt if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? 
pos/cv420_28795.txt what is so special about the " spirits " that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? 
pos/cv420_28795.txt worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you're more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt there's no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . 
pos/cv420_28795.txt you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more .

pos/cv225_29224.txt this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( " i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! " ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt rat race's cast is first rate . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man " born without a personality . " 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! 
pos/cv225_29224.txt and ruthless people . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt this is a fun little feature . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . 
pos/cv225_29224.txt rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you .

pos/cv491_12145.txt all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis .

pos/cv491_12145.txt the problem is that she is only 13 .

pos/cv491_12145.txt the ending is a bit too pat . 
pos/cv491_12145.txt everything is tied up with a neat little bow . 
pos/cv491_12145.txt rosie o'donnell is a stand-out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and " tell it like it is " pronouncements . 
pos/cv491_12145.txt structured somewhat like a " diner , a few years later " , this feel-good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice . 


pos/cv520_12295.txt

pos/cv520_12295.txt when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt yes , most of the kung fu and other " martial arts " flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . 
pos/cv520_12295.txt so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . 


pos/cv835_19159.txt

pos/cv835_19159.txt i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) , except if you're child ? in which case it would be called experimenting . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt hardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt despite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt well , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt and it's sweet . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt drew barrymore who shone in ? ever after' is wonderful as ? josie , grossy' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt it addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt hard to believe , but possible . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt there may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it . 
pos/cv835_19159.txt either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending . 


pos/cv633_29837.txt

pos/cv633_29837.txt historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with " oscars " . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt in his time , english king edward i " longshanks " ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by " ius primae noctis " and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt what makes braveheart " larger than life " is his protagonist . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt from the technical point of view , the film is also very good . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of " longshank " 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in " politically correct " hollywood . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . 
pos/cv633_29837.txt in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .
