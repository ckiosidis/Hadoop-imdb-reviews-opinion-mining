pos/cv001_18431.txt every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the plot is deceptively simple . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt george washington carver high school is having student elections . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt mr . " m " ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the similarities are staggering : 
pos/cv001_18431.txt tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt he even gets a bee sting . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt he gets several bee stings . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt and so on . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt what happened ? 
pos/cv001_18431.txt how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? 
pos/cv001_18431.txt even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt witherspoon is a revelation . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? 
pos/cv001_18431.txt even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . 
pos/cv001_18431.txt there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .

pos/cv115_25396.txt i know that " funnest " isn't a word . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt  " fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt what sort of pies ? 
pos/cv115_25396.txt chicken pies , of course . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt  " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
pos/cv115_25396.txt park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . " 
pos/cv115_25396.txt there's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt why ? 
pos/cv115_25396.txt because once you got past the thought that " they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt conversely , " chicken run " doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt if you've never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt the animation is first-rate . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . 
pos/cv115_25396.txt funnest damn movie i've seen all year . 


pos/cv703_16143.txt

pos/cv703_16143.txt  " you've got mail " is the very definition of a " cute " movie . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt it's got cute stars , a cute story-line , and even cute pets . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt despite this over-whelming cuteness ( or maybe because of it ) , i loved " you've got mail " . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt i know , i know . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt i'm supposed to be a film critic . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt i'm not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt but darn it , somewhere along the way , " you've got mail " reeled me in , hook , line , and sinker . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt the movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends , without ever knowing each others identity . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt as the movie progresses , though , they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt meanwhile , in " real-life " , they are bitter competitors . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt she owns a quaint little children's bookstore , he owns one of those gigantic super-bookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt while his store threatens to run her store out of business , their online relationship grows stronger . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt  " you've got mail " is as artificial as movies come . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt everything is nice and happy and by the end , all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt there are no real conflicts , no major disappointments , no unresolved issues . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt nevertheless , i quite enjoyed it . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt in fact , i can't remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt in particular , hanks is at his best here , turning his " charm-meter " up to 11 . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt everytime he was on screen , he had my full attention . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt and despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business , i was rooting for him . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman . 
pos/cv703_16143.txt  " you've got mail " certainly won't be winning any awards , but as an exercise in pure entertainment , it's as good as it gets . 


pos/cv029_18643.txt

pos/cv029_18643.txt seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' 
pos/cv029_18643.txt for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . 
pos/cv029_18643.txt `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .

pos/cv682_16139.txt you don't have to know poker to like " rounders , " but it might help . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york's cardshark underground astoundingly doesn't limit its accessibility , even for those who can't tell royal and straight flushes apart . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt  " rounders " ' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don't have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt matt damon , fresh off his " good will hunting " hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt things change , however , when mike's old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt that " rounders " ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt director john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs " red rock west " and " the last seduction , " gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be worth catching even if " rounders " ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt if only the other character interaction was as successful , " rounders " might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year's best films . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt current " it girl " gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike's girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt john turturro's aging mentor and famke janssen's tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt and as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for " rounders " ' moral . 
pos/cv682_16139.txt that moral , by the way , is " our destiny chooses us , " and it's something of a surprise when " rounders " supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be .

pos/cv823_15569.txt the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt no situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .

pos/cv823_15569.txt the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever . 
pos/cv823_15569.txt the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .

pos/cv808_12635.txt did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 
pos/cv808_12635.txt that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the background to the case is such . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt as von bulow , he is brutally evil . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt however , legally , did he do the murder ? 
pos/cv808_12635.txt schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt we don't know what happened . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . 
pos/cv808_12635.txt irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .

pos/cv123_11182.txt andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . " 
pos/cv123_11182.txt they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt  " evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to " the top " ) . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt okay , it is a let-down . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt >from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt her death , though , is brilliant . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt her singing could be better though . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti 
pos/cv123_11182.txt lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . 
pos/cv123_11182.txt like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's " everyone says i love you " ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

pos/cv042_10982.txt meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's " a " list . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt robin williams is excellent in this role . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt good will hunting has all three . 
pos/cv042_10982.txt if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go .
