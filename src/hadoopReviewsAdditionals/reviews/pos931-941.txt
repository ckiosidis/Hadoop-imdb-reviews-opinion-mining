pos/cv071_12095.txt zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero takes the case , and the plot thickens . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt take , for starters , the great cast of characters . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt  " i'll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt  " i have a gun , and everything . " 
pos/cv071_12095.txt his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . 
pos/cv071_12095.txt and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . 


pos/cv436_19179.txt

pos/cv436_19179.txt contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains " pure research " in favor of science with " commercial applications . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt hadden ( john hurt ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt of course , the big question becomes " who gets to ride it ? " 
pos/cv436_19179.txt  ( right after " who's gonna pay for this thing ? " ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep " godless science " from talking to god , or something like that ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt then hadden reappears with startling news . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt when she returns home , no one believes her . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt  . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt  . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt eighteen hours worth of static ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt religious people are presented as shallow caricatures . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist " religious " doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt what ellie should have said was , " you shouldn't believe me . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone . " 
pos/cv436_19179.txt that is the voice of science speaking . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt also , his profession of " faith " before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt people watching this film in the future will say , " hey , this never took place during clinton's term . " 
pos/cv436_19179.txt this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? 
pos/cv436_19179.txt personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology . 
pos/cv436_19179.txt i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .

pos/cv990_11591.txt when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt lebowski's passion is bowling . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt even worse , they urinate on his rug . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife .

pos/cv990_11591.txt the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine .

pos/cv990_11591.txt this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the kidnappers are impossibly inept . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the dude and his cronies are even worse . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt every plan goes awry . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam .

pos/cv990_11591.txt donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " .

pos/cv990_11591.txt more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .

pos/cv990_11591.txt  " when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling " ? 
pos/cv990_11591.txt maybe there's no real message . 
pos/cv990_11591.txt perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world .

pos/cv947_10601.txt

pos/cv947_10601.txt the premise is simple , if not bizarre . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt why ? 
pos/cv947_10601.txt it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt mst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . 
pos/cv947_10601.txt most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .

pos/cv481_7436.txt apocalypse now , based on the novel " hearts of darkness " , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt in many ways , this debate could go either way . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with " extreme prejudice " because he has been deemed a murderer . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt willard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt accusing someone of murder in this situation is like " handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " , as he puts it . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt it doesn't make too much sense . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt the men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt surf . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt duvall's portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt eventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz's frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt one of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt kurtz is actually well aware of willard's mission , and refers to him as " an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill " . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt yet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt apocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt a movie that will hypnotize you with it's brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt definitely on the " do not miss " list . 
pos/cv481_7436.txt be prepared for a very memorable film .

pos/cv976_10267.txt robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because " i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . " 
pos/cv976_10267.txt all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt upon my first viewing i left bawling . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt it is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt that is what a river runs through it does . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt both times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . 
pos/cv976_10267.txt but the dream is lovely .

pos/cv690_5619.txt charlie sheen stars as zane , a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt when he finally gets one , his boss destroys the tape and fires him . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt naturally , zane is not ready to give up , and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt he is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt so zane goes down there to investigate , and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt zane is having marital problems at the time , and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt hearing charlie sheen deliver the line , " i guess there is something to be said for celibacy " is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt this is just the setup , and i don't want to give too much away , because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt charlie sheen , who has had a rocky career as of late , is in top form here . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt he is funny , serious , and determined to accomplish his goal . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt sheen's absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt the story is ingeniously devised by twohy , who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour : disaster in time . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt the films major flaw is a very slow pace , and not much happens in the earlygoings . 
pos/cv690_5619.txt viewers may be growing restless for a while , but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it , you will have a good time .

pos/cv532_6522.txt i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt and when it doesn't work , it's just dull . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt is brilliant . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt anyone who comes to mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's " kennedy room , " a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , " they blew up congress ! " 
pos/cv532_6522.txt and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt jim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt was in production long before that film's release . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt cronenberg's movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won't be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! 
pos/cv532_6522.txt is surely a similarly elegant nightmare . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt this is not a nice movie . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt  ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) 
pos/cv532_6522.txt by setting the film's final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton's invasion epic suggests that the world we've got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie's wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . 
pos/cv532_6522.txt ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year's funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . 


pos/cv508_16006.txt

pos/cv508_16006.txt maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it goes from character to character . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike " patch adams , " effortlessly emotional and real . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt in short , this movie is just awesome . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt director anand tucker tells this story well . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar " shine " in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in " beloved " : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? 
pos/cv508_16006.txt hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in " as good as it gets " : great performance , but easy job . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from " breaking the waves " and " the boxer " ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in " rainman " ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt it's so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be . 
pos/cv508_16006.txt but , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . 


pos/cv620_24265.txt

pos/cv620_24265.txt set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie " genre " that ellis helped to create . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news' song " hip to be square " right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' " hip to be square " and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don't expect to see them on the soundtrack release . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of " stuck in the middle with you " in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i'm assuming that collins requested the same . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of " the greatest love of all " is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt apparently , houston wasn't as open about the use of her song as the others were . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film's release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i'm still undecided . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman's reality ) . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt it may not change anyone's life , but it will certainly have an effect . 
pos/cv620_24265.txt i know i will certainly hear " hip to be square " in a different context the next time i hear it .
