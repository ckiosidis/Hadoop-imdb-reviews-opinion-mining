pos/cv921_12747.txt originally titled 'don't lose your head' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt two english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt ffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt  ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) 
pos/cv921_12747.txt once at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt he tells her his identity and gives her his locket . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! 
pos/cv921_12747.txt jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt they pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the 'chateau neuve' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! 
pos/cv921_12747.txt a more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert's thick-witted crony . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt although it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . 
pos/cv921_12747.txt definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . 


pos/cv625_12440.txt

pos/cv625_12440.txt one of the best movies i've ever seen . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the strength of this film is it's gritty realism . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt and the ending . . . . . . whoa . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt how could they have chosen between these three actors ? 
pos/cv625_12440.txt there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt it's impossible . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ? 
pos/cv625_12440.txt that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt no cardboard characters here . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt pearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i really can't fault this movie at all . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce . 
pos/cv625_12440.txt i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : ) 


pos/cv149_15670.txt

pos/cv149_15670.txt the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt williams is the title character , hunter " patch " adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place . 
pos/cv149_15670.txt by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family . 


pos/cv814_18975.txt

pos/cv814_18975.txt when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! ' 
pos/cv814_18975.txt i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings' . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt if only he would dither a little less . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt julia knows this role well . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment . 
pos/cv814_18975.txt how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice . 


pos/cv782_19526.txt

pos/cv782_19526.txt probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- " . . and 
pos/cv782_19526.txt they lived happily ever after . . " . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt smith ( bernard hill ) . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt cameron could as well have called his picture " the never ending love " or " love at first sight " , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you 
pos/cv782_19526.txt name it . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt jack is perfect , but he is - poor . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt on the other hand we have cal . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt cameron knows precisely what we want to see . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a " tragic love story " , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the " greatest film of all time " . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt the main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt titanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt it's a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece . 
pos/cv782_19526.txt it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film . 


pos/cv819_9364.txt

pos/cv819_9364.txt one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt this rule applies highly to kiss the girls . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt before she is abducted . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt sometimes a simple shot is the best one . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt two other essential aspects of the film are quite good . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt part of the blame falls on david klass . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt i must also say that i loved the ending . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . 
pos/cv819_9364.txt perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . 


pos/cv656_24201.txt

pos/cv656_24201.txt i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt everyone loves surprises . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move . 
pos/cv656_24201.txt they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .

pos/cv285_16494.txt you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt and the two are kept busy . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt one , the other or both are in nearly every scene . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt the ephrons' script is witty and sharp . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling . 
pos/cv285_16494.txt committed to lifelong learning through effective communication

pos/cv306_10364.txt in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt will is a troubled individual . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt will flees , but lambeau tracks him down . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a " taster's choice moment . " 
pos/cv306_10364.txt later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt  ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) 
pos/cv306_10364.txt director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . 
pos/cv306_10364.txt good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the " good " in the title .

pos/cv966_28832.txt marie ( charlotte rampling , " aberdeen " ) and jean ( bruno cremet , " sorcerer " ) are a comfortable , sixty-ish married couple looking forward to a peaceful vacation at their second home in lit et mix . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt on their first , full day , marie sunbathes as jean goes for a swim . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt hours later , marie's initiated a full scale search when jean hasn't returned , but no trace of him is found . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt marie returns to paris and resumes her life , including chats with jean at the end of each day in francois ozon's " under the sand . " 
pos/cv966_28832.txt marie's ex-pat british friend amanda ( alexandra stewart , " frantic " ) and her french husband gerard ( pierre vernier ) try to snap marie out of her denial with a dinner party , where they introduce her to the handsome vincent ( jacques nolot , " nenette et boni " ) , yet marie suggests that gerard accompany her and jean to their gym the next morning . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt eventually marie does begin dating vincent , but she discusses him with jean and even smiles at jean , hidden behind a bedroom curtain , when she makes love to vincent . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt slowly , though , reality continues to chip away at marie's fantasy life . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt her bank advises her that without access to jean's account , she needs to reduce her spending . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt one of her university students ( she's reading virginia woolf's " the waves " ) turns out to be one of the young men who participated in the beach search . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt then police arrive asking her to identify the clothing of a body they've found washed up from the ocean . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt that night , jean's not at home when she returns to their apartment . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt her mother-in-law ( andree tainsy ) cruelly 
pos/cv966_28832.txt insists that jean simply abandoned her out of boredom . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt finally , marie goes to the police , insisting on viewing the body . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt horrified ( she's been warned it was 
pos/cv966_28832.txt in an advanced state of putrefaction ) , she laughs when handed a bagged watch , insisting that this is not her husband . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt  " under the sand " is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging ( 'i've lost my youth , ' marie declares ) and loss . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt charlotte rampling , given the chance to portray an older , yet still sexual , woman runs with it , bringing us into the mind of the character . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt as marie returns from her first date with vincent , she sits on the couch with jean . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt 'did he kiss you ? ' he asks . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt the mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt ozon ( " water drops on burning rocks , " " see the sea " ) , who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim , marcia romano , and marina de van , has turned in a more mature work than his previous , creepy " see the sea . " 
pos/cv966_28832.txt while he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day , leaving a number of possibilities - accident ? , suicide ? , escape ? 
pos/cv966_28832.txt - open , he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt cinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie ( " water drops on burning rocks " ) glides around marie ( their 180 shot as she initially searches the ocean's horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic ) or captures rampling's exotic face in mood divining closeup . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt in an inventive fantasy scene , marie imagines jean's hands massaging her feet while in a state of auto-arousal . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt his two hands become four , then more combined with her own , becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanski's " repulsion . " 
pos/cv966_28832.txt original music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt  " under the sand " is a unique portrait of loss . 
pos/cv966_28832.txt it would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmann's " faithless " from earlier this year , another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons .
