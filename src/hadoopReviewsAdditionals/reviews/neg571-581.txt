neg/cv766_7983.txt be forewarned . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt  " quick , robin ! 
neg/cv766_7983.txt the anti-shark repellant ! " 
neg/cv766_7983.txt - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg 
neg/cv766_7983.txt i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? 
neg/cv766_7983.txt i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt  ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted " bomb ! " 
neg/cv766_7983.txt each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) 
neg/cv766_7983.txt is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? 
neg/cv766_7983.txt i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt mr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of " cool ! " 
neg/cv766_7983.txt in the least inventive way . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt his batman is hardly an imposing figure . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt the film's one saving grace ? 
neg/cv766_7983.txt undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt ms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt  ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . ) 
neg/cv766_7983.txt her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie . 
neg/cv766_7983.txt  " at " , of course , is the operative word . 


neg/cv215_23246.txt

neg/cv215_23246.txt libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt she's convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt time passes , and the friend disappears with matty . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell " daddy ! " 
neg/cv215_23246.txt and realizes that her husband is still alive . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt libby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the " double jeopardy " amendment she can off him with impunity ) . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt when she gets parole , she's sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt travis pursues , naturally . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt  " double jeopardy " is a watered-down version of " the fugitive , " with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt character development is thin . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt travis' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt  ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt it's a long way to go for one line ) . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt there's considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there's something " the fugitive " didn't have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt libby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt this is judd's most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt let's hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt the quality of director bruce beresford's movies seems to depend on luck . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt when he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like " 'breaker' morant , " " driving miss daisy , " and " tender mercies . " 
neg/cv215_23246.txt when he doesn't . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt  . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt  . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt we get " double jeopardy . " 
neg/cv215_23246.txt screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on " the rock , " a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites . 
neg/cv215_23246.txt bottom line : ashley judd tries hard but can't save this predictable bore . 


neg/cv045_25077.txt

neg/cv045_25077.txt when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt am i enjoying myself ? 
neg/cv045_25077.txt is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 
neg/cv045_25077.txt this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt daily news ? 
neg/cv045_25077.txt negative . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt reelviews ? 
neg/cv045_25077.txt negative . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt epinions . com ? 
neg/cv045_25077.txt negative . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt this was nothing new . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt whoops . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt boys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt it is almost offensive . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt an example of an insightful conversation : 
neg/cv045_25077.txt  " you're dumb . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . " 
neg/cv045_25077.txt  " no . " 
neg/cv045_25077.txt  ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) 
neg/cv045_25077.txt  ( well it's not as bad as wing commander i guess ) 
neg/cv045_25077.txt the supporting cast is also painfully useless . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt teenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt maybe i should rent she's all that again . 
neg/cv045_25077.txt is it really as good as i think it is ? 


neg/cv968_25413.txt

neg/cv968_25413.txt while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt she simply turns the film into a pity party . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt his roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt and professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt i don't know . . . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt comic . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel's " scarborough fair/canticle . " 
neg/cv968_25413.txt instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist's foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt in loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul's dorm " hunt's hall " after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt her gift with casting proved to be her curse . 
neg/cv968_25413.txt loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? 


neg/cv131_11568.txt

neg/cv131_11568.txt about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out " i hope she gets killed now ! " 
neg/cv131_11568.txt at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt every year , a couple films like this are released . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun " the peacemaker , " featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt  " the jackal " tries to mix both elements . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt and you thought " the saint " was bad . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt  " the jackal " is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , " the day of the jackal , " which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or 
neg/cv131_11568.txt is he ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from " romeo + juliet " ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the script of " the jackal " is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt or is it a combination of both ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt  " the jackal " aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the supporting characters are worse . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt what is poitier doing here ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt he's one of the best living actors ! 
neg/cv131_11568.txt does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt geez ! 
neg/cv131_11568.txt is there anything good here ? 
neg/cv131_11568.txt well . . . a 
neg/cv131_11568.txt couple things . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is " the jackal . " 
neg/cv131_11568.txt director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior " rob roy " ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . 
neg/cv131_11568.txt every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( " clear and present danger , " which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but " the jackal " is an example of when they go completely wrong .

neg/cv390_12187.txt synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt this turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either . 
neg/cv390_12187.txt don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . 


neg/cv162_10977.txt

neg/cv162_10977.txt  " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . " 
neg/cv162_10977.txt the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? 
neg/cv162_10977.txt he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt whatever . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . 
neg/cv162_10977.txt it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own . 


neg/cv145_12239.txt

neg/cv145_12239.txt it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief .  
neg/cv145_12239.txt however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . 
neg/cv145_12239.txt no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films .

neg/cv421_9752.txt the cartoon is way better . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic " home alone " with puppies , and not much else . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be " why ? 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? " 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt they drag their " human pets " together , and in a short time both couples marry . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy's new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog's view of humans as their pets . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt while he drew the desired " aww , they're so cute " reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering " i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that ? " 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt in " something wild " , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt in " terms of endearment " , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt with a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt she's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt when she spits out lines like " you've won the battle , but i'm about to win the wardrobe ! , " 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the film comes briefly to life . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt  " 101 dalmatians " is crammed with john hughes' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence . 
neg/cv421_9752.txt  " 101 dalmatians " has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another .

neg/cv268_20288.txt

neg/cv268_20288.txt as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt so far it sounds interesting right ? 
neg/cv268_20288.txt not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt after that , they basically run around killing . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt obviously that's not the case here . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt can't the camera men sit still ? 
neg/cv268_20288.txt i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? 
neg/cv268_20288.txt well now i know . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt what's there to argue about anyway ? 
neg/cv268_20288.txt the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit . 
neg/cv268_20288.txt please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .
