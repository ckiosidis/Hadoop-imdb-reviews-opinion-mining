neg/cv019_16117.txt mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt that's some ape . " 
neg/cv019_16117.txt joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt he picks things up and stares at them pensively . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt as a character , he doesn't quite register . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt the picture is a remake of the 1949 film . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt the movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt but the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt the movie also has bad dialogue . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn't happy ! " 
neg/cv019_16117.txt and " joe isn't safe here ! " 
neg/cv019_16117.txt  " we need to get joe out of here ! " 
neg/cv019_16117.txt  " joe is way too big for that cage ! " 
neg/cv019_16117.txt i don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt it's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . 
neg/cv019_16117.txt nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . 


neg/cv599_22197.txt

neg/cv599_22197.txt the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt if you haven't already figured it out , i didn't like this movie very much . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt  ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) 
neg/cv599_22197.txt anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt of course , jane is hot on her ape man's heals . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? 
neg/cv599_22197.txt it's actually an improvement over the real thing . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt the acting is just plain awful . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt added to the sound problems was the cinematography . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt this film was filled with beautiful african scenery . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt then we have the special effects . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt  " special effects in a tarzan movie ? " 
neg/cv599_22197.txt you are no doubt asking yourself ? 
neg/cv599_22197.txt yes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt probably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt in most parts , they weren't bad , just nothing special . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt but , they were more than a little on the hokey side . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt except of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt the grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that point . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt it almost looked like they had run out of money . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix . 
neg/cv599_22197.txt stay far away from this version of tarzan . 


neg/cv497_27086.txt

neg/cv497_27086.txt this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned 
neg/cv497_27086.txt kelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt this scene is set in 1871 . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein's lyrics , which tells -- of ned's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt ned says a debt must be paid . . . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt so begins ned's romp through australia's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt when he's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt when ned's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother's freedom . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who don't trust the traps ( police ) . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt spoiler to follow in the next paragraph . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt ned's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt but kelly's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt under richardson's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry . 
neg/cv497_27086.txt if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner . 


neg/cv994_13229.txt

neg/cv994_13229.txt movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt six days , seven nights is simply a waste . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt let's see . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt  . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt  . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt so , how do we do that ? ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt well , we'll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we'll make him a crusty old pilot . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt but wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt i know ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt they'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt yessssss ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt shucks . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt oh , i've got it ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt oh , yes ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt i feel so good about this story . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt imagine that . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt  ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , " why did you pick this awful script ! ? " ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt when i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for " two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . " 
neg/cv994_13229.txt  ? why didn't she know the name of the film ? ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt i suppose she just didn't care . 
neg/cv994_13229.txt  ? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ? 
neg/cv994_13229.txt good actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents .

neg/cv508_17742.txt if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to . 
neg/cv508_17742.txt one of the latter set , " the wedding singer , " seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine .

neg/cv508_17742.txt and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle . 
neg/cv508_17742.txt the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . 
neg/cv508_17742.txt both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds .

neg/cv508_17742.txt the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself .

neg/cv508_17742.txt he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene .

neg/cv508_17742.txt other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie . 
neg/cv508_17742.txt lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression . 


neg/cv800_13494.txt

neg/cv800_13494.txt there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of " scream queen " in the early '80s . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt the same " god , i'm scared , there's some guy in a mask coming after me " routine she did in john carpenter's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt terror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt most of them won't make it to med school , though , and it's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , " i wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train . " 
neg/cv800_13494.txt the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt from the beginning , he's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers " think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? " 
neg/cv800_13494.txt as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt i forgot to mention the prologue . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt it's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he's going to get laid . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt she says , " kiss me , kenny , " and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt  ( " oh my god , they killed kenny ! 
neg/cv800_13494.txt you bastards ! " ) 
neg/cv800_13494.txt it's a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn't let in on . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt she still hasn't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( " you asshole , you can't have a good time without hurting somebody ! " ) . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt the killing starts before the train even leaves the station . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt since it's new year's , everyone's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one's looking . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt at least one of the characters says it's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield " as the magician , " who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt then there's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt for all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt only die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . 
neg/cv800_13494.txt i mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ? 
neg/cv800_13494.txt terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car .

neg/cv540_3092.txt whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt somewhere along the line , the " star trek " film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt generations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name .

neg/cv540_3092.txt among those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt seventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt soran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt i don't think it is an insult to fans of " star trek " to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a " trek " film . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt it's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt data ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt in the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? 
neg/cv540_3092.txt he doesn't get a joke . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt if the rest of the " next generation " cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt perhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt by contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt these characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt it's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the " trek " universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt not just for the enterprise crew , although you'd think by the 24th century space travel wouldn't involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt no , i think the audience might need them more . 
neg/cv540_3092.txt this journey is one bumpy ride .

neg/cv913_29127.txt frank detorri's ( bill murray ) a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin ) . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt when he uses the '10 second rule' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp's cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt inside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote-pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it's up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly's " osmosis jones . " 
neg/cv913_29127.txt the city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt he's inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv's " frasier " ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt this quarrelling duo are about to go on a " fantastic voyage " in order to hunt down thrax ( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt while the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones' story is a hackneyed one . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt the story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule , he departs on a bus headed for bladder ) . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated " predator " ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt meanwhile , back in live action land , bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross-out joke . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt there's no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon ( she plays shane's teacher , mrs . boyd ) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child's father will play to the family audience as well . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt rest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt while far less offensive than the farrelly's last effort " me , myself and irene , " that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey's hijinx . 
neg/cv913_29127.txt  " osmosis jones " will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune . 


neg/cv916_17034.txt

neg/cv916_17034.txt ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt  " she's all that " has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt  ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad ) . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt  " she's all that " tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt that , right there , is problem #1 . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt how many times have we seen this storyline ? 
neg/cv916_17034.txt as cook comments near the end of the film , " it's kind of like " pretty woman " , except without the prostitution " . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt as it is , though , " she's all that " relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt there's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt i was never convinced that she was a " nerd " , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt as for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt and for some indiscernable reason , he's got hearing aids . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt no explanation is given and they're never brought up . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ? 
neg/cv916_17034.txt i don't think so . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i've seen in a movie in a long time . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt  " she's all that " sucks . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt that's what it boils down to . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt it's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt and what's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt it appears to be telling them , " hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt that's unimportant . 
neg/cv916_17034.txt if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron . " 
neg/cv916_17034.txt ugh .

neg/cv196_28898.txt susan granger's review of " america's sweethearts " ( columbia/sony ) 
neg/cv196_28898.txt what a waste of a talented cast ! 
neg/cv196_28898.txt billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt  ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) 
neg/cv196_28898.txt for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt but the laughs are few and far-between . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt basically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . 
neg/cv196_28898.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " america's sweethearts " is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial .
