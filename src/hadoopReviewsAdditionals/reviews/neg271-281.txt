neg/cv015_29356.txt john carpenter makes b-movies . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt always has ( " halloween , " " escape from new york , " " the thing " ) and , by the looks of it ( " they live , " " escape from l . a . , " " vampires " ) , always will . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled " john carpenter's ghosts of mars " ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's " ghosts of mars " ) . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt like all those films prefixed by the very possessive " john carpenter's , " " ghosts of mars " is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt dormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- " species " films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james " desolation " williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt in the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named " desolation " ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try too hard . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt  " ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt carpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt it's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt i never thought i'd miss the guy but i do . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt it's not * all * the same , however . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt dubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt  " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt the irony is that the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt two things keep " john carpenter's ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt 1 . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not . 
neg/cv015_29356.txt what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

neg/cv353_19197.txt rated r . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt but here , he gets himself into a bind . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt it was the hottest summer on record . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more " eccentric , " and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt at the top of the list is ritchie . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded " so what ? " 
neg/cv353_19197.txt question springs to mind . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt you'd never guess from his performance . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt but it's also empty , pretentious and boring . 
neg/cv353_19197.txt like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .

neg/cv827_19479.txt the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over you're glad that you didn't waste more than an hour and a half of your time . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt it's nothing more than a bad rip-off of , " jaws " ( and i think that's being kind . ) 
neg/cv827_19479.txt it was written by david e . kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda . " 
neg/cv827_19479.txt the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt if they had any brains the croc wouldn't have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't be a movie . 
neg/cv827_19479.txt basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered . 


neg/cv379_23167.txt

neg/cv379_23167.txt in my review of " the spy who shagged me , " i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  " scream 3 " provides the latest proof of this rule . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt in los angeles production has begun on " stab 3 : return to woodsboro , " the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt however , life soon starts imitating art , and " stab " cast members turn up stabbed . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in " stab 3 . " elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt indeed , " scream 3 " tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original " scream . " 
neg/cv379_23167.txt at the scene of each murder in " scream 3 , " the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt unlike its predecessors , " scream 3 " doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the driven young director ( scott foley ) ? 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first " scream " was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  " scream 3 " also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from " seinfeld " ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- " scream " job search . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying " the blair witch project " 's web strategy . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt  " scream 3 " has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the " latest 'stab 3' news . " 
neg/cv379_23167.txt there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more " stab " scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the " scream " series . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt there's a " halloween h2k " in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in " h20 , " and a " freddy vs . jason " has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were " killed off . " 
neg/cv379_23167.txt there's bound to be a " scream 4 " someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . 
neg/cv379_23167.txt bottom line : they should have called this one " yawn . "

neg/cv564_12011.txt my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt i also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt off the high board . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' 
neg/cv564_12011.txt then i realized he was , and i was watching it . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt i found this scene offensive . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! 
neg/cv564_12011.txt `my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt in this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt instead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . 
neg/cv564_12011.txt crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon .

neg/cv930_14949.txt _soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt if there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt the story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? ) 
neg/cv930_14949.txt after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt there's a new wrinkle , though . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt todd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt it's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt unlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt add into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt and the special effects ! 
neg/cv930_14949.txt remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ? 
neg/cv930_14949.txt gary busey is in this movie . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt 'nuff said . 
neg/cv930_14949.txt _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults .

neg/cv872_13710.txt

neg/cv872_13710.txt fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt before the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt in short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . 
neg/cv872_13710.txt  ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) .

neg/cv507_9509.txt midway through " anaconda " , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says " i thought this movie would be my first big break . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt instead , it's turned into a disaster . " 
neg/cv507_9509.txt truer words have never been spoken . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt  " anaconda " is a monster movie with a lousy monster . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt the main difference between the giant snake in " anaconda " and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt  " anaconda " boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt but enough about the phony snakes . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt now it's time to talk about the lousy story . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt stoltz tells his crew " pray that you didn't forget your bug spray . " 
neg/cv507_9509.txt apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from " jaws " and " dead calm . " 
neg/cv507_9509.txt one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? 
neg/cv507_9509.txt also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? 
neg/cv507_9509.txt ah , the mysteries of hollywood . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt lopez , who starred in " selena , " is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of " jonny quest . " 
neg/cv507_9509.txt at one point , he looms over the crew and says " the anaconda is the perfect killing machine . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt  " that moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt almost . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out " anaconda . " 
neg/cv507_9509.txt don't . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer , including another " alien " sequel . 
neg/cv507_9509.txt wait for them , rent " jaws " in the meantime , and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this . 


neg/cv478_15921.txt

neg/cv478_15921.txt there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt the badness of patch adams is stupefying . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt it's confounding . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i can't believe a film can be this bad . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt but the film fails fundamentally in execution . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt every scene swells with grand , " emotional " music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt real drama is character-based . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt that's why patch adams is not real drama . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt sentimentality like this is indeed bad . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt you see , patch is a really great student . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt  " why don't we see patients until the third year ? " he bursts out every three seconds . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt most of us have to study . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to " prevent death , " but to " improve the quality of life ! " 
neg/cv478_15921.txt yes ! 
neg/cv478_15921.txt that is true ! 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and you can not do that without studying . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt you can not do that without going to medical school . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt follow the rules ? 
neg/cv478_15921.txt bah ! 
neg/cv478_15921.txt who needs the rules ! 
neg/cv478_15921.txt only uptight doctors follow the rules . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt a free clinic . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt in the middle of the forest . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt where patients can be taken to be helped . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt for free . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? 
neg/cv478_15921.txt will it have an emergency room ? 
neg/cv478_15921.txt or is it just for mental patients ? 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? 
neg/cv478_15921.txt the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i know nothing about him . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . 
neg/cv478_15921.txt patch adams is the cheapest of them all .
