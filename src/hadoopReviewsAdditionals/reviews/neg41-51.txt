neg/cv559_0057.txt this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt if i had to list a reason why . . . . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt good music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt somehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt frankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt after this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt if i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt it might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt i don't . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt  . 
neg/cv559_0057.txt avoid . 


neg/cv593_11931.txt

neg/cv593_11931.txt back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt last action hero . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and " got lost . " 
neg/cv593_11931.txt if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's " stream " of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt they encounter another ship . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt they board it . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt alien spiders attack them . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt they return to their ship . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt the other one explodes . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt they land on a deserted planet . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt and so on . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt for a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt digital effects . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny's pet . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ? 
neg/cv593_11931.txt but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt i don't think so . 
neg/cv593_11931.txt in a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic's 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ?

neg/cv388_12810.txt ugh . that about sums this movie up . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt just , ugh . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt dignity ? 
neg/cv388_12810.txt not quite the word i'm looking for . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt you understand , right ? 
neg/cv388_12810.txt and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever' . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt leave it to america to screw the whole thing up . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt >from the 'geniuses' that brought us " independece day " , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt summing up the movie is simple . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt simple as that . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show " mad about you " . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt the dialogue seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt i can see the scene on the set right now . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt  " all right ! 
neg/cv388_12810.txt we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's going to bomb in our faces .

neg/cv388_12810.txt make up something , m'kay ? 
neg/cv388_12810.txt good . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt roll film ! ! " 
neg/cv388_12810.txt the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well-done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind ) . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt still , an hour into it , you will become antsy , wondering how long they can drag it out . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt and drag it out they do ! ! 
neg/cv388_12810.txt i have to laugh . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt the slogan for the film is , " size does matter " . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt i think they cut this too short . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt it should read , " size does matter . 
neg/cv388_12810.txt acting does not . " 


neg/cv161_12224.txt

neg/cv161_12224.txt this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt tarzan continues this trend . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . 
neg/cv161_12224.txt and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . 


neg/cv615_15734.txt

neg/cv615_15734.txt i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt let's say you've just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt your friends have left to go get help , and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt a tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt do you : 
neg/cv615_15734.txt a ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , 
neg/cv615_15734.txt b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? 
neg/cv615_15734.txt if you answered " a " , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " and will likely hate this movie . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt however , if you answered " b " , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! 
neg/cv615_15734.txt  " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " is being called a sequel , but it's really more of a remake of the original . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt there's a few changes here and there , but it's essentially the same ( even the infamous " meathook " scene has been re-created . ) 
neg/cv615_15734.txt the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt needless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt much carnage ensues . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt the dialogue is even more atrocious . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt zellwegger , who is kidnapped by " the family " early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt when you're surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt speaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt apparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn't * get caught in the window . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt this was one of many glaring inconsistencies . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt there are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt he plays a member of " the family " with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can't help but be amazed by his performance . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt he obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt he makes jack nicholson's portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in " the shining " look restrained in comparison . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt for a horror movie , " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " contains surprisingly little gore . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt in fact , in contains none . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt there's a little blood here and there , but that's as far as it goes . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt which leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt everything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt especially leatherface . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt once frightening and nightmare inducing , he's now as terrifying as dame edna . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . 
neg/cv615_15734.txt check out the far superior original instead . 


neg/cv333_9443.txt

neg/cv333_9443.txt as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt lomax is soon given the case of his life . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt granted , the film is very handsome-looking . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt as with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt pacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt the focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt this movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . 
neg/cv333_9443.txt however , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all .

neg/cv087_2145.txt two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the script for this film is completely pathetic . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt here is an example of the wonderful dialog . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . " 
neg/cv087_2145.txt this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . " 
neg/cv087_2145.txt i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt very impressive trick ! 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the one ( half ? ) 
neg/cv087_2145.txt plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . 
neg/cv087_2145.txt oh well , win some , lose some .

neg/cv644_18551.txt critique : i've been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now , but hold on to your brooms and incantations , cause this puppy is far from being it ! 
neg/cv644_18551.txt for a film that has the word " magic " in its title , this movie contains very few moments of magic . . . or 
neg/cv644_18551.txt humor for that matter , drama , suspense , or romance . 
neg/cv644_18551.txt well actually , there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled , it never lets you in on whether it's a comedy , a drama , a horror show , or a murder mystery . 
neg/cv644_18551.txt or maybe it's a romance , eh ? 
neg/cv644_18551.txt it doesn't really matter , cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting , that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them , or the film as a whole . 
neg/cv644_18551.txt if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack , this film might've had a chance to be more than what it is now . 
neg/cv644_18551.txt which is an unentertaining , crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag of stupid voice-overs , overdone songs , melodramatic romance , undeveloped story and uneven acting . 
neg/cv644_18551.txt i only wish that i could make that one hour and forty-five minutes of my life re-appear , but alas , it is lost in the spiritual world of " interesting ideas gone wildly awry " .

neg/cv334_0074.txt i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt i didn't like it . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt that's the kernel of it , anyway . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt and then there's the special effects . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt nope , it's another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , " nightmare at 20 , 00 feet " episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn't know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt f'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! 
neg/cv334_0074.txt let him loose ! 
neg/cv334_0074.txt let him grin demonically ! 
neg/cv334_0074.txt skip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! 
neg/cv334_0074.txt watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , " what a waste " . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt if you're going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he's not sure what he should be doing next . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt and no wonder . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it'd just love to be allegory , but it's not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it'll think of something . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt so what is the witches of eastwick ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt a horror movie ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt a folk tale ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt a comedy ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt a statement about women ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? 
neg/cv334_0074.txt i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching 
neg/cv334_0074.txt someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt in other words , a mess . 
neg/cv334_0074.txt  ( $2 . 00 ) 
neg/cv334_0074.txt if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . 


neg/cv604_23339.txt

neg/cv604_23339.txt an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt all in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them . 
neg/cv604_23339.txt i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie .
