pos/cv861_1198.txt an indian runner was more than a courier . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt he * became * the message he was carrying . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt what danger is a bear , to a message ? 
pos/cv861_1198.txt i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt but all that has changed now . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt the guy has grown up . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt and that's not all . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt but , no . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt the focus of the story is two brothers . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt it isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt in fact , i'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all . 
pos/cv861_1198.txt in my opinion , it is worth full-price admission .

pos/cv233_15964.txt  " a bug's life " may not be " toy story , " but it's more close than " antz " was . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt i really liked " antz , " basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt  " a bug's life " has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like " antz " was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt  " antz " is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and " a bug's life " is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in " antz . " 
pos/cv233_15964.txt it's also light and clever . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of " antz " at least a worthy contender . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from " antz , " but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt not that the plot's really any better than the one in " antz " - it's basically yet another redux of " the seven samurai , " with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt he runs into a group of " warrirors " who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in " toy story " : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says " kid tore off wings . " 
pos/cv233_15964.txt and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something " antz " couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , " a bug's life " pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing " antz " with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt still , it's no " toy story . " 
pos/cv233_15964.txt that film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . 
pos/cv233_15964.txt yet " a bug's life , " as well as " antz , " are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof . 


pos/cv379_21963.txt

pos/cv379_21963.txt in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? 
pos/cv379_21963.txt although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt it was the light comic touch that burton applied . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt `sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . 
pos/cv379_21963.txt if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time . 


pos/cv107_24319.txt

pos/cv107_24319.txt is evil dead ii a bad movie ? 
pos/cv107_24319.txt it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt `well what's it about ? ' 
pos/cv107_24319.txt `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . ' 
pos/cv107_24319.txt `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt why should i see it again ? ' 
pos/cv107_24319.txt `no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . ' 
pos/cv107_24319.txt `it's funny to see people die ? 
pos/cv107_24319.txt are you sick or something ? ' 
pos/cv107_24319.txt maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . 
pos/cv107_24319.txt ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . 


pos/cv376_19435.txt

pos/cv376_19435.txt i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt `american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt just how great are their hormones raging ? 
pos/cv376_19435.txt one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but what is the perfect time ? 
pos/cv376_19435.txt there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . 
pos/cv376_19435.txt but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . 


pos/cv844_12690.txt

pos/cv844_12690.txt warren beatty's " bulworth " is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt however , as loud and raucous as it is , " bulworth " speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( " the lemon sisters " ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , " america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt blah , blah , blah . " 
pos/cv844_12690.txt when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they " put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . " 
pos/cv844_12690.txt later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because " my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . " 
pos/cv844_12690.txt all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt  ( don cheadle of " boogie nights " ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like " boyz'n'hood " ( 1991 ) and " menace ii society " ( 1993 ) . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt  " bulworth's " chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt other than that , " bulworth " hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . 
pos/cv844_12690.txt unlike " primary colors " which opened earlier this year , " bulworth " doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on . 


pos/cv043_15013.txt

pos/cv043_15013.txt if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named " pleasantville . " 
pos/cv043_15013.txt maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt fine performances are turned in all around . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . 
pos/cv043_15013.txt there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't .

pos/cv554_13151.txt there's good news and bad news about mulan . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt cartoons . . . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt that's chinese culture for you . . . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt it should have been called g . i . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt chang . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt mulan calls on her ancestors for help . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt you ain't never had a friend like mushu . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( " heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . " ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt the best of the bunch , sad to say , is " be a man , " the requisite basic training montage song . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , " be a man " accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? 
pos/cv554_13151.txt i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt otherwise , mulan is a good movie . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt hell , george " mr . sulu " takei does a voice in mulan . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt you get the sense disney said to themselves , " alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt who can you think of ? " 
pos/cv554_13151.txt  " well , there's mr . myagi . . . " 
pos/cv554_13151.txt  " good . " 
pos/cv554_13151.txt  " and mr . sulu . " 
pos/cv554_13151.txt  " perfect . 
pos/cv554_13151.txt we've got ourselves a movie now . " 
pos/cv554_13151.txt soon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind . 


pos/cv186_2269.txt

pos/cv186_2269.txt i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt wisely , he never aims for saintly . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt it's one of mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt it's easy to see mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt but mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . 
pos/cv186_2269.txt and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . 


pos/cv069_10801.txt

pos/cv069_10801.txt stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt this is a long welcome reunion . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt  * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . 
pos/cv069_10801.txt dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .
