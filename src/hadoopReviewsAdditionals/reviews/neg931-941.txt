neg/cv950_13478.txt the most interesting part of " can't hardly wait " just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost 
neg/cv950_13478.txt too nicely . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the " american grafitti " or , to a lesser extent , the " dazed and confused " cliche . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt  " can't hardly wait " just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of " that thing you do ! " ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his " love " for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even 
neg/cv950_13478.txt though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after " dick tracy " ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt ugh . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not " american grafitti " or " dazed and confused , " two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably " sixteen candles . " 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and 
neg/cv950_13478.txt then says that it's all okay . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? 
neg/cv950_13478.txt but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in " radio days " ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt she may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves " well , at least we'll be entertained . " 
neg/cv950_13478.txt a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt we don't feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ? 
neg/cv950_13478.txt the answer for this film is no . 
neg/cv950_13478.txt nice try , though . 


neg/cv429_7937.txt

neg/cv429_7937.txt  " ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ? 
neg/cv429_7937.txt and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? 
neg/cv429_7937.txt rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt i didn't laugh , but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt what we get is just another retread of the " underdog sports team " mixed with some cross dressing . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt unfortunately , the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? 
neg/cv429_7937.txt he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't even give him falsies . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ? 
neg/cv429_7937.txt martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ? 
neg/cv429_7937.txt just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt i've seen worse movies than " ladybugs , " but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is . 
neg/cv429_7937.txt dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price . 


neg/cv254_5870.txt

neg/cv254_5870.txt even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt then comes the transparent plotline . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt first they're singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt the jokes are right out of " mchale's navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! " 
neg/cv254_5870.txt i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . " 
neg/cv254_5870.txt i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson . 
neg/cv254_5870.txt i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! " 
neg/cv254_5870.txt without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .

neg/cv041_22364.txt out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt what a mess . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt the limey does exactly that . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt there is no method to this movie's madness . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . 
neg/cv041_22364.txt shall we go back to basics ?

neg/cv927_11471.txt the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . 
neg/cv927_11471.txt finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . 
neg/cv927_11471.txt combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of " kramer vs .

neg/cv927_11471.txt a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform .

neg/cv446_12209.txt

neg/cv446_12209.txt here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt observe the opening sequence . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt he is undecided . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt this happens for about 10 seconds . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt the audience finds some humor in his foolishness . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt the lights suddenly go out . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt cisco is surprised and says : " whoa . . . let's 
neg/cv446_12209.txt go ! " 
neg/cv446_12209.txt and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt melvin must now find a way to stay alive . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ? 
neg/cv446_12209.txt cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt and so on . . . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ? 
neg/cv446_12209.txt what goes on among this clique ? 
neg/cv446_12209.txt why is cisco at odds with melvin ? 
neg/cv446_12209.txt there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on . 
neg/cv446_12209.txt if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now . 


neg/cv780_8467.txt

neg/cv780_8467.txt sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt take this film , " naked killer " , among it's ingredients are heavy doses of violence , rape sequences , straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls " coarse language " . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ? 
neg/cv780_8467.txt one word - penis . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt that's it . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is " penis . " . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt it really restores you're faith in the system , huh ? 
neg/cv780_8467.txt anyway , that's just a side point . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne , it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip , cool , controversial thriller . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt what they forgot to mention was that it isn't very good . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt the plot involves male cop tinam ( simon yam ) , investigating a series of brutal murders . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty ( chingmy yau ) , who , after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father , falls in with professional killer sister cindy ( svenwara madoka ) . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt realising kitty has potential , cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt however in the course of his investigation tinam ( who believed kitty had disappeared ) , runs into her again , but isn't quite sure if it's her . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt to complicate matters the actual serial killlers , princess and baby , who a former students of cindy , and have been told to kill their old master and her new student . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt from then the action ensues . . . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt all in all , this is not a well done movie . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt the script is awful , the direction all over the place , the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt the shoot out in the car park is almost woo-like in adrenaline . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt let me put this way , if you like action - get something else , if you like strong women in movies - get something else , if you have do decide between this and " black cat " for your hong kong female action - don't get either . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt even for curiosity value it just isn't worth it . 
neg/cv780_8467.txt let's face it - if ever the was a movie that became popular on it's subject alone , this is it . 


neg/cv897_11703.txt

neg/cv897_11703.txt synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? 
neg/cv897_11703.txt it's hard to speculate . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt there's really not much to say . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt the plot sucks . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt the dialogue stinks . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist . " 
neg/cv897_11703.txt someone could have used an editor ! 
neg/cv897_11703.txt to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ? 
neg/cv897_11703.txt as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . 
neg/cv897_11703.txt if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
