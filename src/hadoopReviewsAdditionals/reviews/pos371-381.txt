pos/cv978_20929.txt starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt rated r . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt her friend gives her son the phone . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt nick walks in the room . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt little matty screams " daddy ! " 
pos/cv978_20929.txt the phone goes dead . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's " adopter " . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt it's not like it matters . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt in some films , plausibility is everything . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt this is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt she brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt double jeopardy is really good , but it isn't the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt it's one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt this is a thriller that isn't concerned with being smart or plausible . 
pos/cv978_20929.txt instead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none .

pos/cv942_17082.txt it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? 
pos/cv942_17082.txt this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? 
pos/cv942_17082.txt the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . 
pos/cv942_17082.txt just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . 


pos/cv081_16582.txt

pos/cv081_16582.txt since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , " anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . " 
pos/cv081_16582.txt drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt her role is instantly likeable . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt he's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt october sky should be a success with audiences . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . 
pos/cv081_16582.txt it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . 


pos/cv963_6895.txt

pos/cv963_6895.txt i can hear the question already . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt what on earth do these two movies have in common ? 
pos/cv963_6895.txt to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt but oh , how differently the packages affect their films . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt while " everyone's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt i left " everyone says i love you " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt i left " the portrait of a lady " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt  " everyone " features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt similar situations happen to his family and friends . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his " early , funny " films . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of " take the money and run , " his directorial debut . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt and what better way to express feeling than through music ? 
pos/cv963_6895.txt love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in " portrait of a lady , " too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . 
pos/cv963_6895.txt why ? 
pos/cv963_6895.txt with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only " everyone says i love you " was able to make my heart sing . 


pos/cv079_11933.txt

pos/cv079_11933.txt no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , " that movie was so unfunny ! " 
pos/cv079_11933.txt  " i didn't know what to expect . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it . 
pos/cv079_11933.txt i still don't know how to react . "

pos/cv544_5108.txt

pos/cv544_5108.txt no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- " keyser soze " in latin means " an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . " 
pos/cv544_5108.txt or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f " times new roman " \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie ) . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like " the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist " ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt we see the story unfold as spacey retells it . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent " cripple " character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv . 
pos/cv544_5108.txt a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . . 


pos/cv173_4471.txt

pos/cv173_4471.txt with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt copycat is a good thriller . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . 
pos/cv173_4471.txt nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .

pos/cv903_17822.txt robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt she exclaims " here i come ! " 
pos/cv903_17822.txt and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as " a southern spin on fargo , " except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific " aunt alexandria " character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) 
pos/cv903_17822.txt there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt cookie's fortune is such a movie . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt i even liked the trite " in the south everybody is related to everybody " cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt i'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . 
pos/cv903_17822.txt perhaps it's that good ol' southern charm .

pos/cv113_23102.txt the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's " final solution . " 
pos/cv113_23102.txt each of the five tells his or her story . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to " work " camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it's not clear which scene it is . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , 
pos/cv113_23102.txt so the richness and detail are impeccable . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt he ends his prayer by saying " . . . forgive me for surviving . " 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well . 
pos/cv113_23102.txt it's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .

pos/cv234_20643.txt when i saw the trailer for " the sixth sense , " i didn't expect much from it . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of " the shining " or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called " freak " by the other boys in the neighborhood . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see " the sixth sense . " 
pos/cv234_20643.txt anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt the box office success of " the sixth sense " has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but " the sixth sense " isn't really a horror film . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt at its core , " the sixth sense " is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , " i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun " ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! 
pos/cv234_20643.txt although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt if only willis' work were as impressive . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt  ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , " the story of us , " which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt writer/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . 
pos/cv234_20643.txt bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .
