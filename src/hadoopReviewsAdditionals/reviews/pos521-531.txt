pos/cv878_15694.txt  " i know what you did last summer , " the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996's " scream , " and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997's biggest hit of the fall season . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt while " scream " was a more knowing film about the genre , " i know what you did last summer " is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the " friday the 13th " films ( well , okay , " jason goes to hell " was pure hell to sit through ) . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt kind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt distraught and confused , they decide they can't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , " i know what you did last summer , " and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt  " i know what you did last summer , " is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt heche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt  " i know what you did last summer , " could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt prinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted " jump-in-your-seat " scare . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i've ever heard . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best " scream queen . " 
pos/cv878_15694.txt and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . 
pos/cv878_15694.txt although not up to the level of either " scream " movies , or the more recent , " urban legend , " " i know what you did last summer " is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made .

pos/cv268_18834.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
pos/cv268_18834.txt analyze this 
pos/cv268_18834.txt how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ? 
pos/cv268_18834.txt well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! 
pos/cv268_18834.txt failed to really get the joke . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt this time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and 
pos/cv268_18834.txt for plenty of reasons . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt the story goes like this . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt first , of course , he's a mobster , but secondly , he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt and , of course , he can't rest worth for a moment because the mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can't always be taken for laughs , you know ) . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt  ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) 
pos/cv268_18834.txt crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt kudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wife-to-be , who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro's presence . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt is the movie perfect ? 
pos/cv268_18834.txt not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either . 
pos/cv268_18834.txt line of the movie : crystal : " when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! " 


pos/cv761_12620.txt

pos/cv761_12620.txt film adaptation of hunter s . thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) 
pos/cv761_12620.txt  " apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie " , according to gilliam . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt during their trip , they systematically consume " two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt note : i have not read thompson's book . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt it was 1971 , and the times were apparently " a' changing " in the states . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ? 
pos/cv761_12620.txt  ( 7/10 ) . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt in 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he'd tried every drug by the age of 14 . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . 
pos/cv761_12620.txt johnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself " mr . stench " , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose " winona forever " tattoo had to be altered to " wino forever " after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called " p " , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a . 


pos/cv480_19817.txt

pos/cv480_19817.txt the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt from there , things become a little more complicated . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt although i know it was all a staged " mockumentary " , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i didn't feel much upon initially watching it . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt this is not a movie that hits you right away . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt this is as real as it gets folks . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd's . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt i know i'll be first in line to buy one . 
pos/cv480_19817.txt [r] 


pos/cv424_8831.txt

pos/cv424_8831.txt i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt however , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt like rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt the trailer for the film sums it up quite well . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt first strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt jackie chan is a regular comedian . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt well , he's no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt for example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt even the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt but never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident . 
pos/cv424_8831.txt with some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention .

pos/cv134_22246.txt

pos/cv134_22246.txt  " stuart little " is one of the best family films to come out this year . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt stuart little is a mouse . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt george doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt hesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt just like in " star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace " stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt another movie that this has in common with is " babe " with it's talking animals and people understanding them . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt michael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the " homeward bound " movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt when he was timon in 1994's " the lion king " i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in " stuart little " he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's " jerry maguire " . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt even though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt  " stuart little " is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt we get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know " stuart little " and " toy story 2 " are by far the best family films this year . 
pos/cv134_22246.txt a winner . ?

pos/cv423_11155.txt seen at the 21st portland international film festival 
pos/cv423_11155.txt film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt funny and pointed in its own way . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt goro has a supermarket . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and the procedures , are not always " fresh " food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt in the process , they also find that " freshness " ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt but this would take away from the satire and its strengths . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt and what fun it is . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt worth seeing . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt  ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt we could learn something along the way , too . . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt tampopo is also very enjoyable . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . 
pos/cv423_11155.txt ask for it .

pos/cv356_25163.txt as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a " to kill " list for his enemies . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt as gibson delivers lines like , " before this war is over , i am going to kill you , " schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt and isn't that the point of the patriot ? 
pos/cv356_25163.txt gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as " cowardly " and " sadistic . " 
pos/cv356_25163.txt i disagree with this accusation . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? 
pos/cv356_25163.txt heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? 
pos/cv356_25163.txt the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times . 
pos/cv356_25163.txt god bless america ! 
pos/cv356_25163.txt and god bless the patriot ! 


pos/cv148_16345.txt

pos/cv148_16345.txt warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) 
pos/cv148_16345.txt instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) 
pos/cv148_16345.txt it's remarkable that this film was released at all . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt  ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) 
pos/cv148_16345.txt and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt they're not cringe inducing , at least . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . 
pos/cv148_16345.txt bulworth , then , is well worth watching .

pos/cv169_23778.txt virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt all the films released after it , have been less successful . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt 'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt in a near future . . . on 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the first " download into simulation " is impressive . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people " wake up " in unknown places and strange things start happen . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt they start to doubt in their own sanity . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their " users " and creators with their sanity and their lives . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt with an appealing ( " blade runner " - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this contrast demonstrates a wish for change . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt for others - a way to start over and " correct " their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt at least that's how it is all beginning . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 
pos/cv169_23778.txt what is thought ? 
pos/cv169_23778.txt who are we ? 
pos/cv169_23778.txt if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt this film is interesting and inspiring . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . 
pos/cv169_23778.txt with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .
