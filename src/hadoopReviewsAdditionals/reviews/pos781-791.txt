pos/cv543_5045.txt getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt but thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt much to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt getting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt birdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt the scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt getting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . 
pos/cv543_5045.txt director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery .

pos/cv112_11193.txt i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire " wag the dog , " but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's " dr . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt strangelove " in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt that said , " wag the dog " is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt as i said , " wag the dog " is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform " we have the right to fight for democracy . " 
pos/cv112_11193.txt another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt william " old shoe " schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the " fighting " has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? 
pos/cv112_11193.txt the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt with these plot holes , " wag the dog " doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt i think it's fair to say that " wag the dog " underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . 
pos/cv112_11193.txt wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ? 
pos/cv112_11193.txt with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . 


pos/cv562_10359.txt

pos/cv562_10359.txt aliens ! ! well , that is what this movie is about . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt computer generated aliens . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt ok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt well , in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft , squishy and cuddly kind . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt j , well soon to be j , a smart ass cop ( played by will smith ) runs down what he thinks is a would-be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt k aims to recruit our poor j , but that is not the whole point of this movie . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the dialogue is witty to say the least . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt i would have to say that k is more amusing than j , but what's one without the other . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt especially the evil alien , he did need some work . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt though this could have been worked on , the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt that was achieved rather well , with some interesting commentary and observations . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt a movie worth a view , but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smith's form of humor then i wouldn't go . 
pos/cv562_10359.txt originally written after original release .

pos/cv258_5792.txt

pos/cv258_5792.txt jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , " best to tell the truth , isn't it ? 
pos/cv258_5792.txt that way nobody gets hurt . " . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever " been with a black man " , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's " just dropping by " when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look " as bad as possible " to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , " i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs " ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , " if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . " 
pos/cv258_5792.txt as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
pos/cv258_5792.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
pos/cv258_5792.txt see it twice .

pos/cv198_18180.txt bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
pos/cv198_18180.txt rush hour 
pos/cv198_18180.txt so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? 
pos/cv198_18180.txt they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( " i'm michael jackson , you tito . " ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt the story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt at least it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt a particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt and the finale's a real treat as well . . . chan 
pos/cv198_18180.txt delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt rush hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night of the week . 
pos/cv198_18180.txt just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and you'll be fine- drunken master ii this ain't . 


pos/cv131_10713.txt

pos/cv131_10713.txt no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt  " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt the ending of " jude " is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt  " jude " offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what " jude " is . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt kate winslet , in a pre- " titanic " performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see " titanic , " branagh's " hamlet , " " sense and sensibility , " and " heavenly creatures , " the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . 
pos/cv131_10713.txt  " jude " moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts .

pos/cv495_14518.txt of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt think about it . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt if you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt there's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt  ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . ) 
pos/cv495_14518.txt but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt any day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt he is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt yet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt  ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) 
pos/cv495_14518.txt unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . 
pos/cv495_14518.txt as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .

pos/cv165_22619.txt in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt this creates some strange effects . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt as studies of characters these stories are each worth following . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt heavy spoiler . . . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt heavy spoiler . . . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt heavy spoiler . . . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt heavy spoiler . . . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt and in actual fact , it does . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the cause is associated with whirlwinds . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt  ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) 
pos/cv165_22619.txt otherwise the event was quite believable . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt  " and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . " 
pos/cv165_22619.txt however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt note that the previous verse says " and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , " 
pos/cv165_22619.txt so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . 
pos/cv165_22619.txt the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .

pos/cv789_12136.txt ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends 
pos/cv789_12136.txt synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt  " paulie the talking parrot " ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt as a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt by attending marie's speech lessons , paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt unfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt paulie's biggest wish is to return to marie . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt he is sent to a cruel research facility , where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt will misha help paulie get back to marie ? 
pos/cv789_12136.txt opinion : every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well-meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt soon enough , " birthday kid " loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt my sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt please think twice before buying one . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt okay . back to the story . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt in movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt paulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt paulie is for kids . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a " stupid furball . " 
pos/cv789_12136.txt sometimes , however , there are statements the kids don't get . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt for example , when paulie's elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands ) dies , paulie explains , " well , one day , the cat got her . " 
pos/cv789_12136.txt and you hear kids exclaim , " what cat ? ! " 
pos/cv789_12136.txt imagine lassie come home , except with a doll-sized human dressed as a bird , and you'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird tries to get home . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird meets elderly friend . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird loses elderly friend . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird meets eccentric friend . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird loses eccentric friend . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt bird meets bad influence . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt and so on and so forth , with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado ) . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt the bottom line ? 
pos/cv789_12136.txt break out the popcorn money , moms and dads . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt paulie may be the low end version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he'll do . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i'm sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way . 
pos/cv789_12136.txt and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy , " well , one day , the cat got her . " 


pos/cv867_16661.txt

pos/cv867_16661.txt wong kar-wei's " fallen angels " is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of " fallen angels " , this is not so . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal " knock off " ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt ugh . ) 
pos/cv867_16661.txt the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt i can't say much more than that as i didn't really know what was going on most of the time . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt the constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt we're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt  " fallen angels " is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt in fact , i'd go so far as to say that " fallen angels " is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i've ever seen . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt sure , there's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt there were far too many instances during " fallen angels " in which i asked myself , " now who are these people again ? 
pos/cv867_16661.txt is this that first couple or the second couple ? " 
pos/cv867_16661.txt it was impossible to keep track . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with " name cards " , as in scorsese's " mean streets " . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt that's really besides the point , though . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that's he's a movie-maker to watch . 
pos/cv867_16661.txt let's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .
