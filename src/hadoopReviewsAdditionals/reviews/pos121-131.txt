pos/cv986_13527.txt i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you have to reach for a larger audience . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt in any case , the answer is no . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt warning : major spoilers follow ! 
pos/cv986_13527.txt please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you have been warned . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the x-files is what a summer should be . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt so yeah , the x-files is scary . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt and guess what ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt do not think that the x-files is a monster movie . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " showers " independence day . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be " showering " godzilla instead . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who 
pos/cv986_13527.txt cares ! ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
pos/cv986_13527.txt unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! 
pos/cv986_13527.txt the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt  ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emotional scene " between godzilla attacks ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt cool effects ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt it's got some . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt pulse pounding ? 
pos/cv986_13527.txt hell yes ! 
pos/cv986_13527.txt strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many " whoah , i never saw that one coming ! " 
pos/cv986_13527.txt moments , four " holy shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an ending . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt you may wonder where this movie lost half a star . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . 
pos/cv986_13527.txt it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . 


pos/cv404_20315.txt

pos/cv404_20315.txt in , " the muse " albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt so he turns to his " best " friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ? 
pos/cv404_20315.txt when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt  " she doesn't do any actual writing , " he is told , " but inspires you . " 
pos/cv404_20315.txt steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . ) 
pos/cv404_20315.txt steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt and that's a question only time will tell . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt  " the muse " is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( " defending your life " and " mother " ) . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt and although " the muse " doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's " the player " i still left the theater feeling good . 
pos/cv404_20315.txt and that's something i wish i got out of more movies . 


pos/cv582_6559.txt

pos/cv582_6559.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt edward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt then again , perhaps it was to him as well . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt these two points don't detract greatly from the film . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt the people vs . 
pos/cv582_6559.txt larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . 


pos/cv259_10934.txt

pos/cv259_10934.txt richard linklater's " slacker , " made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , " oh , you know , just hanging out . " 
pos/cv259_10934.txt linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in " scooby-doo . " 
pos/cv259_10934.txt for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt the only problem with " slacker " is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt there are only so many times you can hear , " hey , what's going on ? " 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  " not much , what are you up to ? " 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  " nothing really , just hanging around , " before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt  " slacker " is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . 
pos/cv259_10934.txt i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . 


pos/cv296_12251.txt

pos/cv296_12251.txt this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt mind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt the movie is really a stand alone in that regard . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt the family robinson . . . lost in space . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt a colonization process , if you will . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are " lost in space " . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt  " how do get back to earth ? " 
pos/cv296_12251.txt is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? 
pos/cv296_12251.txt yawn ! ) . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt on the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for " trying " to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's " evil " , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is " paralyzed " during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that " somehow " they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very 
pos/cv296_12251.txt odd . . . . . ) . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt overall , if you're a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you're not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt garry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months . 
pos/cv296_12251.txt mimi rogers was tom cruise's first wife . 


pos/cv282_6653.txt

pos/cv282_6653.txt ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , 
pos/cv282_6653.txt you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too " big " in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's " kids in the hall " ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , 
pos/cv282_6653.txt you'll see . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt of course , the movie does have its share of silliness . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt but what has he become ? 
pos/cv282_6653.txt a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? 
pos/cv282_6653.txt doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
pos/cv282_6653.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
pos/cv282_6653.txt see it twice .

pos/cv326_13295.txt most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the rocky formula of " rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight " is carried out to the letter . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! 
pos/cv326_13295.txt then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he " pities the fool " for not coming out and fighting him outright . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn't listen . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt naturally , he gets his ass kicked . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt somewhere along the line after this several things happen . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt rocky's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt guess who wins ? 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky' . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt which is good if you like fighting scenes . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt the last match is quite decent actually . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt if you liked the previous films , rent this one . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt it's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series . 
pos/cv326_13295.txt but if you can't stand rocky shouting " adrianne ! ! ! " 
pos/cv326_13295.txt one more time , see something else . 


pos/cv805_19601.txt

pos/cv805_19601.txt after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt this new film has been underrated for no reason . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some " unfinished " developments of some characters . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : " the only wealth in this world is children . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure " . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of " part ii " to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , " a check in the amount of $100 million . " 
pos/cv805_19601.txt but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt but god does not take payoffs . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt there is a moment in " godfather iii " where michael says : " all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . " 
pos/cv805_19601.txt  . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the third installment has only the plot and visuals . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt violence is natural to him . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt i disagree . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt there is no turning back . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . 
pos/cv805_19601.txt here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven

pos/cv073_21785.txt screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt screenplay by andrew kevin walker . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt directed by tim burton . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt i mention these allusions for a reason . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt depp is adequate in his role . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt no more ; no less . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt she's a good witch too . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt how cute . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt you have to pay attention . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . 
pos/cv073_21785.txt if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .

pos/cv526_12083.txt ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition 
pos/cv526_12083.txt synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? 
pos/cv526_12083.txt believe it . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt sliding doors is a love 'what if' story . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt this leads to a life where helen moves out . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt in story two , helen experiences a different fate . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? 
pos/cv526_12083.txt opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! 
pos/cv526_12083.txt nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! " 
pos/cv526_12083.txt when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt there are minor inconveniences . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? 
pos/cv526_12083.txt sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . 
pos/cv526_12083.txt monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?
