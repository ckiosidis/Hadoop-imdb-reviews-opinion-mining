pos/cv681_9692.txt capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt  " serial killer chic " is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt thankfully , that's not the way henry works . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt they are damned together from that moment on . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt i'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of " victim " or " hero " . 
pos/cv681_9692.txt then again , probably , so would henry .

pos/cv859_14107.txt it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt  " apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the plot is fairly simple . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the movie is visually breathtaking . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the problems come when the film slows down . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the film slows down to a drag . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? 
pos/cv859_14107.txt there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . 
pos/cv859_14107.txt there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . 


pos/cv619_12462.txt

pos/cv619_12462.txt originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) , 
pos/cv619_12462.txt starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt this film took john travolta from a dim-witted " sweathog " on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about " drinking lemonade " and " staying out until 10 " with danny in " summer nights " ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i 
pos/cv619_12462.txt am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture . 
pos/cv619_12462.txt conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . 


pos/cv432_14224.txt

pos/cv432_14224.txt based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he 
pos/cv432_14224.txt must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt to some degree , i agree with this sentiment . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt  ( " men in black " is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) 
pos/cv432_14224.txt why is this ? 
pos/cv432_14224.txt for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt superman 
pos/cv432_14224.txt is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt which brings me back to blade . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that 
pos/cv432_14224.txt uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the end results are not pretty by any means . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt add this 
pos/cv432_14224.txt to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an " anti-theft device " ) , and one has an interesting premise . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt however , the film works best as an action film . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt actor wesley snipes has 
pos/cv432_14224.txt an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a 
pos/cv432_14224.txt good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt regardless , this film is far from perfect . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on 
pos/cv432_14224.txt marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt much of the special effects are not that spectacular either . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of 
pos/cv432_14224.txt realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , 
pos/cv432_14224.txt watch " saving private ryan " ) . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt still , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's sword without deactivating the " anti-theft device " . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . 
pos/cv432_14224.txt a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . 


pos/cv265_10814.txt

pos/cv265_10814.txt one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt mark whalberg , a . k . a 
pos/cv265_10814.txt marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) 
pos/cv265_10814.txt boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the soundtrack is also excellent . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt also , the costumes are great . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt the film , although excellent , does have some flaws . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt but the rest of the cast are excellent . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) 
pos/cv265_10814.txt another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt but they're small niggles really . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt boogie nights is an excellent film . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . 
pos/cv265_10814.txt whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights . 


pos/cv300_22284.txt

pos/cv300_22284.txt it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt his pain creates pain for the viewer . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . " 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the speed in " the green mile " is perfect . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt  " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . 
pos/cv300_22284.txt if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

pos/cv736_23670.txt the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt that someone is death . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt is that one helluva premise , or what ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt `final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt `final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt not that the characters are that good . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' 
pos/cv736_23670.txt toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt `spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt not so . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt `final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt what will trigger the accident ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt  ( yeah , sick humor ) . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt will it be the leaking toilet ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the falling fishing reel in the corner ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt it's fun . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you . 
pos/cv736_23670.txt when will your ? design' expire ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt is death waiting around the corner ? 
pos/cv736_23670.txt the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies . 


pos/cv337_29181.txt

pos/cv337_29181.txt when 17 year old beau hall ( jonathan tucker , " the virgin suicides " ) gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion , club owner darby reese ( josh lucas , " session 9 " ) , his mom , margaret ( tilda swinton , " the war zone " ) pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt instead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the next morning margaret discovers darby's dead body on their beach and , suspecting the worst , weights it down in a distant part of the lake . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt but her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , " practical magic " ) in " the deep end . " 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , " the game " ) . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt it's a terrific performance . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding's 40's noir novel 'the blank wall' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese's body has been discovered . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he'll turn the tape over to the reno police . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt there's yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , " dead man walking " ) is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of the money is delivered . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt visnjic's dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret's inherent decency and her workaday surroundings . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt also outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt initially beau's the typical sullen teen . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt 'you're blowing this out of proportion , ' he says of her concerns about reese , not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt as his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn't commit , beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion , turning tables . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt his early black eye becomes her later split lip . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt while the two can never be completely honest with each other , their love for each other comes through strongly . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the directors ( " suture " ) have a firm grip on their material and cast . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt water imagery is constant ( an early shot of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium ) . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt giles nuttgens ( " fire " ) cinematography , which won the 2001 sundance festival award , is crisp and startlingly clear . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt the tahoe locations and production design by kelly mcgehee and christopher tandon provide a dual personality for the film , contrasting the calm , well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt  " the deep end " is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships . 
pos/cv337_29181.txt take the plunge . 


pos/cv886_18177.txt

pos/cv886_18177.txt bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
pos/cv886_18177.txt the mummy 
pos/cv886_18177.txt brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some " americans " . . . and 
pos/cv886_18177.txt guess what ? 
pos/cv886_18177.txt yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy . 
pos/cv886_18177.txt if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . 


pos/cv849_15729.txt

pos/cv849_15729.txt meet joe black is your classic boy-meets-girl , boy-likes-girl , boy-gets-killed-in-horrible-accident , supernatural-entity-takes-over-boy's-body , supernatural-entity-falls-in-love-with-girl story . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt william parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt he has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani ) . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots . . . but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he won't be able to talk his way out of . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt and he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt however , death has a deal to make . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt death has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt in return , william gets to live a few extra days . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt of course , he agrees . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt death , under the human name of " joe black " , gets to experience life as a complete innocent . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt and he's not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt but , is their affair doomed to an early demise ? 
pos/cv849_15729.txt at nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt instead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt the romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt this is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and doesn't want to let it go . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt by contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt she gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt as joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt granted , he's supposed to be out-of-place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt still , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt the main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams' company who is joe black's main rival for susan's affections . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt we never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he's never done something like this before . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices/accents . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt  ( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) 
pos/cv849_15729.txt and the ultimate resolution to one of the film's supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . 
pos/cv849_15729.txt still , even with the film's length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn't necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .
