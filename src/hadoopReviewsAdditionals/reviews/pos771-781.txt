pos/cv378_20629.txt oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt he is simply trying to tame it . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt  " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . 
pos/cv378_20629.txt still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

pos/cv573_29525.txt  " the deep end " uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt alluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt after taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt the production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as " the deep end " gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt spoiler alert : the following reveals the basic storyline . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt i believe the plot points are incidental , because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters , but still , you should proceed at your own risk . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt with her husband tom , a naval officer , often away at sea , margaret hall ( tilda swinton ) holds down the fort , taking care of the children , beau ( jonathan tucker ) , paige ( tamara hope ) , and dylan ( jordon dorrance ) , while her father-in-law jack ( peter donat ) hovers in the background , always watching . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt it seems that beau , her eldest , is having an affair with darby reese ( josh lucas ) , a disreputable sort 12 years his senior . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt margaret demands that darby leave her son alone , only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be glad to steer clear of beau ? for $5000 . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt back at home , she tries to talk about it all with her son , but the kid won't even confirm that he's gay , let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt he does , however , get attentive when she reveals darby's $5 , 000 offer , even as he maintains his sullen demeanor . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt late in the evening , darby shows up outside , tossing pebbles at beau's window like a schoolchild . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt the two meet by the water at the boathouse , where something important happens . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt i won't reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie , by the way . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt within a day or so , margaret's life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic ) turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape , once margaret coughs up $50 , 000 . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt oh , what's a mother to do ? 
pos/cv573_29525.txt end spoilers 
pos/cv573_29525.txt written , directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( " suture " ) , " the deep end " is based on elisabeth sanxay holding's 1940's novel , " the blank wall , " which was also the source of the 1949 film , " the reckless moment . " 
pos/cv573_29525.txt i've neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt in holding's story , the " scandalous " relationship is between an older man and margaret's teen-age daughter . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary , and it also raises questions about margaret's motives . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt many reviews of " the deep end " describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt consider this : margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt her father-in-law is constantly present , almost as if he is monitoring for his son . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt and when her husband does call , margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt so is margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him ? 
pos/cv573_29525.txt or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency , desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea ? 
pos/cv573_29525.txt you sort it out . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt regardless , the resonance of " the deep end " comes from two actors . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt goran visnjic , best known from the tv drama " er , " is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you've seen before . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol , chivalry and simmering eroticism . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt but the star of this show , without a doubt , is the remarkable tilda swinton . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt watch the shadings , depth , resource , vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt days after my second viewing of " the deep end , " i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water . 
pos/cv573_29525.txt  " the deep end " is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it .

pos/cv581_19381.txt eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast " hostage " on the set for nearly a year ) . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt he is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go " show his face " at the house of a just-deceased patient . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the " action " until he is discovered to be an outsider . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt roger ebert calls the american version the " austin powers version , " and many others have bashed the alterations . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . 
pos/cv581_19381.txt still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness .

pos/cv605_11800.txt

pos/cv605_11800.txt i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt the part of jeff " the dude " lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt the dude assumes that these " collection agents " were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as " vaginal ; " steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt they sound natural . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt perhaps " beautiful " is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . 
pos/cv605_11800.txt outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . 


pos/cv458_8604.txt

pos/cv458_8604.txt it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting " americanised " and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? 
pos/cv458_8604.txt larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt but even with such actions , americans remain undecided . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt what they have ignored is actually a great picture . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt edward norton plays their jerky lawyer . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt god's damnation . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt to go beyond good and evil . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . 
pos/cv458_8604.txt this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . 


pos/cv476_16856.txt

pos/cv476_16856.txt one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . 
pos/cv476_16856.txt however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .

pos/cv584_29722.txt the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , " you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet . " 
pos/cv584_29722.txt this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt but jamaica isn't against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . 
pos/cv584_29722.txt if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations .

pos/cv257_10975.txt that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into " the wedding singer , " the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? 
pos/cv257_10975.txt or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? 
pos/cv257_10975.txt or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? 
pos/cv257_10975.txt well , there's a little bit of all of that in " the wedding singer " and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt that's because , in a nutshell , " the wedding singer " is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt that's right . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt sweet . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ? 
pos/cv257_10975.txt well , it's just lovely . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt instead ? 
pos/cv257_10975.txt well , i've said it before . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt sweet . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt aww . . . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt sandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's " white wedding " to the smiths' " how soon is now ? " 
pos/cv257_10975.txt to culture club's " do you really want to hurt me ? " 
pos/cv257_10975.txt the mix of music and fashion would make " the wedding singer " a great double feature with " boogie nights . " 
pos/cv257_10975.txt if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then " the wedding singer " is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt if you're a fan of the lovable , laughable adam sandler , well . . . 
pos/cv257_10975.txt let's just say that " the wedding singer " might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent " happy gilmore . " 


pos/cv728_16133.txt

pos/cv728_16133.txt playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
pos/cv728_16133.txt stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt he practically overflows with passion in every scene . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt  " there's no dog in this play ? " 
pos/cv728_16133.txt  " no ! 
pos/cv728_16133.txt no dog ! " 
pos/cv728_16133.txt the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt but my quibbling is not important . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . 
pos/cv728_16133.txt not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it .

pos/cv965_26071.txt in many ways , " twotg " does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us " the usual suspects " . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt yet , they are incredibly foolish planners . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt actually , these two never really have a plan . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt yet , for the most part , " the way of the gun " stays on target . 
pos/cv965_26071.txt it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry .
