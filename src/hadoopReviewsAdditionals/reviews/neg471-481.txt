neg/cv034_29446.txt if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " 's for you . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt simply remove him from the equation . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt they did it because they wanted to , and because they could . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . 
neg/cv034_29446.txt  " bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death .

neg/cv983_24219.txt tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt the fugitive ? 
neg/cv983_24219.txt not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? 
neg/cv983_24219.txt oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt both movies are on video . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt make the wise choice and pick the fugitive . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend " i miss my son . " 
neg/cv983_24219.txt nothing more , nothing less . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt though i don't think he will win another oscar again . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . 
neg/cv983_24219.txt that would just be plain stupid .

neg/cv475_22978.txt miramax " disinvited " on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt  ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , " 100% cotton " , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) 
neg/cv475_22978.txt of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? 
neg/cv475_22978.txt the backseat ? 
neg/cv475_22978.txt the next car ? 
neg/cv475_22978.txt thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt our other surviving regulars have become estranged . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , " stab 3 " , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of " stab 3 " , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying " all bets are off ! " 
neg/cv475_22978.txt in reference to the " rules " of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of " stab 3 " ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt  ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) 
neg/cv475_22978.txt finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . 
neg/cv475_22978.txt the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' . 


neg/cv253_10190.txt

neg/cv253_10190.txt hey , i've got a great idea for a movie ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt what's that ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt sounds too boring ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain ! " 
neg/cv253_10190.txt looks ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt what's that ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt that still doesn't sound funny to you ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! " 
neg/cv253_10190.txt looks ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt still not funny ? 
neg/cv253_10190.txt if you answered " no , that doesn't sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! ) 
neg/cv253_10190.txt you're absolutely correct ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt  . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt  . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt namely , talent ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt  . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt  . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt except run away and join an amish community . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! 
neg/cv253_10190.txt now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt it bumped seven films up a notch on my " worst of " 1997 movie list . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . 
neg/cv253_10190.txt if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! 


neg/cv260_15652.txt

neg/cv260_15652.txt i have never been a " star trek " fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , " star trek : insurrection , " is no exception . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , " first contact , " " insurrection , " tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt  " star trek : insurrection , " is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's " first contact , " which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt in , " insurrection , " however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? 
neg/cv260_15652.txt another element of , " star trek , " films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , " first contact . " 
neg/cv260_15652.txt she should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt  " star trek : insurrection , " is perhaps the weakest film in the " star trek , " series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , " star trek v : the final frontier . " 
neg/cv260_15652.txt  " insurrection , " is the type of " safe " sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . 
neg/cv260_15652.txt that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . 


neg/cv016_4348.txt

neg/cv016_4348.txt i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt one girl said if i'd seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt nothing could be further from the truth . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt i went into the theater expecting to love the movie . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt where to begin in criticizing this movie ? 
neg/cv016_4348.txt the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt so why does this movie get one star out of me ? 
neg/cv016_4348.txt well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt so you can't call it a sex flick . 
neg/cv016_4348.txt i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? 
neg/cv016_4348.txt bad . 


neg/cv793_15235.txt

neg/cv793_15235.txt this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? 
neg/cv793_15235.txt the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt i feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt connery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt if there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt for one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title . 
neg/cv793_15235.txt i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you .

neg/cv843_17054.txt starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt freeway is giving me second thoughts . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt so what are they doing in this movie ? 
neg/cv843_17054.txt after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? 
neg/cv843_17054.txt because you keep making movies like this . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ? 
neg/cv843_17054.txt note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt bottom line -- i'm still shaking my head . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt don't waste your time on this turkey . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller . 
neg/cv843_17054.txt do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .

neg/cv346_19198.txt if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ? 
neg/cv346_19198.txt  ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . ) 
neg/cv346_19198.txt 1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt how will loveless accomplish this ? 
neg/cv346_19198.txt well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt  ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . ) 
neg/cv346_19198.txt racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's " hip " attitude toward the black thing . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt  ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a " nigger " before that person can finish speaking the word . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt super . ) 
neg/cv346_19198.txt at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt  ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . ) 
neg/cv346_19198.txt jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of " the fresh prince of bel-air " demonstrate . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ? 
neg/cv346_19198.txt this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt  ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops 
neg/cv346_19198.txt him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . ) 
neg/cv346_19198.txt wild wild west's bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant " his master's voice " joke , are all part of the film's first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second . 
neg/cv346_19198.txt when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale . 


neg/cv838_25886.txt

neg/cv838_25886.txt in our time . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt and there are more problems besides its title . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt we call it 'modernization' . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt but there's more than acting to worry about . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt and in the end it's nothing . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt for someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . 
neg/cv838_25886.txt for those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells .
