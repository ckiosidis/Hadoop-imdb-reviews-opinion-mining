pos/cv566_8581.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt the film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt ms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt however , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . 
pos/cv566_8581.txt floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . 


pos/cv952_25240.txt

pos/cv952_25240.txt director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's " pulled back in " to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt and what follows doesn't disappoint . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt good or bad . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the " rival car thief " plot line . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt thereby adding some meat to the plot . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt it's all been done . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt the chase is also shot and edited in that " jerry bruckheimer action sequence " kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? 
pos/cv952_25240.txt it's very hard to tell . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the " bus jumping the ramp " sequence from speed in the " oh , i don't think so . . . " 
pos/cv952_25240.txt department . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt it's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun . . . 
pos/cv952_25240.txt just what a summer flick should be .

pos/cv774_13845.txt

pos/cv774_13845.txt almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and " newbie " , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan's red october . 
pos/cv774_13845.txt if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach . 


pos/cv585_22496.txt

pos/cv585_22496.txt denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt he is that amazing . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt >from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt his anger is heightened to a point of no control . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt he realizes that society is changing . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt if only the other actors had this same determination . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt  " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in " shawshank redemption " ) . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " 
pos/cv585_22496.txt it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . 
pos/cv585_22496.txt this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 


pos/cv841_3967.txt

pos/cv841_3967.txt let's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt with no new eye-candy for four weeks straight , we've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi-nutritional value of cheatin' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt sigh . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt thank god for desperado . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi--director robert rodriguez's notorious $7000 debut--stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt he's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt  ( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . ) 
pos/cv841_3967.txt so , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex-mex version of the punisher , if you will . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt there isn't much of an emotional core to desperado . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt  ( and sergio leone . . . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt and sam peckinpah . . . ) 
pos/cv841_3967.txt some may wince at the body count--at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate--but it's all played for laughs . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt big , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films . 
pos/cv841_3967.txt sick , slick fun . 


pos/cv100_11528.txt

pos/cv100_11528.txt james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v 
pos/cv100_11528.txt sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt but then again , pets are always cute on screen . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt and this is the films main problem . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . 
pos/cv100_11528.txt overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) 
pos/cv100_11528.txt not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun . 


pos/cv009_29592.txt

pos/cv009_29592.txt the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt mostly it's laughable . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . 
pos/cv009_29592.txt aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . 


pos/cv166_11052.txt

pos/cv166_11052.txt contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of " merely listening " to sounds out in space . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as " a man of the cloth , without the cloth " . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a " supreme being " , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt meanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? 
pos/cv166_11052.txt even when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where " right and wrong " is only opinion ( at least speaking " politically correctly " ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt don't get me wrong . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt as much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt despite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) 
pos/cv166_11052.txt highly depreciated on the small screen . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as " sci-fi " . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . 
pos/cv166_11052.txt this is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .

pos/cv884_13632.txt the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) 
pos/cv884_13632.txt caught in his zipper , and misses the big night . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt then again , maybe my expectations were too high . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt not a good place to be . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the " right guy " ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt funny stuff . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of " build me up buttercup " , which is really cool . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script " dust to dust " into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt matt dillon is a high school dropout . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt close to home in his native new york , he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt cameron diaz stands 5 " 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt ben stiller's father is jerry stiller . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's " seinfeld " . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt peter farrelly has written a novel entitled " outside providence " which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran . 
pos/cv884_13632.txt harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man . 


pos/cv936_15954.txt

pos/cv936_15954.txt it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , " american history x " does it , and for that , i commend it . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt  " american history x " is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt or at least , that's the intention . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to " correct " him . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on " mein kampf , " landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt but danny won't . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt  " american history x " is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the " fat skinhead , " whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from " boy meets world , " and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt sorta . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt  " american history x " is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt although he aimed for the directing credit to go to " alan smithee , " the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt this will not be a " do the right thing " for the late 90s . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . 
pos/cv936_15954.txt and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .
