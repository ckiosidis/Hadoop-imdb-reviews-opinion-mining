pos/cv157_29372.txt synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt but " quills " also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt rush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt kaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant . 
pos/cv157_29372.txt for two hours , " quills " acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul .

pos/cv658_10532.txt finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt  ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles . ) 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin has some great lines . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds " i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . " 
pos/cv658_10532.txt don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt he's an equal opportunity bigot . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt and she's none too happy about it . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt this doesn't upset melvin much ( " don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time " ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt he even develops a friendship with simon . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt all three people are heavily damaged . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin has retreated from life in his apartment . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt  " you make me want to be a better man , " he tells her . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt nicholson may be the best actor working today . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt their on-screen chemistry is a bit odd . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there's something a little off . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt it's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film . 
pos/cv658_10532.txt director james l . brooks ( " terms of endearment " , " broadcast news " ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands .

pos/cv275_28887.txt after the press screening of " moulin rouge , " i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt when one fellow quietly stated " i've never really been a fan of musicals , " the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt there is so much going on in " moulin rouge " that " musical " seems too small a term to cover it . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " moulin rouge " is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind " strictly ballroom " and " romeo + juliet , " fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from " the sound of music " to " smells like teen spirit . " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , " moulin rogue " travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the " random " setting . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt oh , and it has a story as well . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , " to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , " where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named " spectacular spectacular . " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt like a teeter-totter , " moulin rogue " moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like " bewitched " beat into the ground . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " we never heard from baz to turn it down , " one of the actors told the los angeles times . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " it was always , 'more ! 
pos/cv275_28887.txt more ! ' " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt the director even sent a note to his cast reading , " i dare you to make me say you've gone too far . " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt the musical numbers reflect his attitude . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt one knockout piece , the " elephant love medley , " incorporates the beatles' " all you need is love , " u2's " in the name of love , " dolly parton's " i will always love you " and elton john and bernie taupin's " your song . " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt need more ? 
pos/cv275_28887.txt how about " diamonds are a girl's best friend " spiced with portions of " material girl ? " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt mcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt once labeled the " ice queen , " nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform " like a virgin . " 
pos/cv275_28887.txt as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt i suspect " moulin rogue " will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt while i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt over the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other . 
pos/cv275_28887.txt  " moulin rogue " is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished . 


pos/cv305_9946.txt

pos/cv305_9946.txt of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many " laugh-out-loud " moments . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this " mockumentary " as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt teaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! 
pos/cv305_9946.txt if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt thankfully , just as your about to say " ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom " , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people ! 
pos/cv305_9946.txt even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful ! 
pos/cv305_9946.txt as a word of note , despite it's " r " rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt it's actually quite humorous and tastefully done ! 
pos/cv305_9946.txt it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt it's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it . 
pos/cv305_9946.txt it's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones ! 
pos/cv305_9946.txt i'd recommend seeing it ! 


pos/cv299_16214.txt

pos/cv299_16214.txt expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt one can almost sense the cold . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt in a gym bag . ? 
pos/cv299_16214.txt affliction too was set in a snowy landscape . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt it really seems very simple . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt turns out . . . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt well , see the movie . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt one should be warned against seeing the trailer . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . 
pos/cv299_16214.txt but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . 


pos/cv051_10306.txt

pos/cv051_10306.txt every year , hollywood crowns a new " it boy " --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt inheriting the mantle from last year's " winner , " matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . 
pos/cv051_10306.txt so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come .

pos/cv425_8250.txt as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens , i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers , i can't say that i do exactly . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed , so therefor she does not believe . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite ? 
pos/cv425_8250.txt that's the catch-22 . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they didn't really * fax * them . . . ) 
pos/cv425_8250.txt ellie wants to be the one to go , but because of her atheism she is denied the position . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt how dumb is that ? 
pos/cv425_8250.txt she discovers the transmitions , then she isn't allowed to go . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt well , because of a bomb and a psychopath ( jake busey ) , she * does * end up going , but not in the way that we would've thought . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt contact is based on a novel by carl sagan , who died during the filmmaking . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind , and will end up being the best film of the year . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some , but will stimulate more . 
pos/cv425_8250.txt i'm glad at least one movie of the '90s can portray aliens in a psitive light , rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body . 


pos/cv349_13507.txt

pos/cv349_13507.txt martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . 
pos/cv349_13507.txt personally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . 
pos/cv349_13507.txt scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . 
pos/cv349_13507.txt the set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . 
pos/cv349_13507.txt political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . 


pos/cv380_7574.txt

pos/cv380_7574.txt ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt yuck . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt but it's not really too bad . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt it has a lot working against it , for me at least . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film ) . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt will they finally kiss ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt well , what do you expect ? 
pos/cv380_7574.txt but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt one word of caution , though . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt this film is being billed in some places as a " family " movie . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt don't let that stop you . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
pos/cv380_7574.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
pos/cv380_7574.txt see it twice .

pos/cv044_16969.txt actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .

pos/cv044_16969.txt the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . 
pos/cv044_16969.txt when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that .
