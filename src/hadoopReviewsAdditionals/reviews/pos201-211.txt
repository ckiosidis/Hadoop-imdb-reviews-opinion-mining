pos/cv888_24435.txt imagine this . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt this is the life of a gladiator . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt >from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt phoenix plays his character brilliantly . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he's not the center of attention . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! 
pos/cv888_24435.txt the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . 
pos/cv888_24435.txt along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 . 


pos/cv403_6621.txt

pos/cv403_6621.txt my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt this movie was exceptional for many reasons . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i'll let you fiqure which is which ) . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt also , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . 
pos/cv403_6621.txt experience counts for a lot ! ! 


pos/cv834_22195.txt

pos/cv834_22195.txt  " sometimes the 'green mile' seems sooooo long . " 
pos/cv834_22195.txt indeed . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to " old sparky , " the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you've got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they " talk to " the convicts instead of yelling at them . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt immediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he " takes back " paul's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt based on steven king's 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner " fry " up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he's witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt while it is mr . hanks " everyman " performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt all involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt if only the story were more credible . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt writer/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt mr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? 
pos/cv834_22195.txt by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt much has also been made of coffey's christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey's powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like " i feel your pain " transference . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt in contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt the genuine " gifts of healing " listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt true spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . 
pos/cv834_22195.txt such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god . 


pos/cv820_22892.txt

pos/cv820_22892.txt i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative " process " that everyone is trying to get their hands on . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his " process . " 
pos/cv820_22892.txt through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross' boss mr . klein . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt played by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott's joe ross . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt the character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt david mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . 
pos/cv820_22892.txt this is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . 


pos/cv452_5088.txt

pos/cv452_5088.txt if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt is he planning to start world war iii ? 
pos/cv452_5088.txt cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , " ace of spies . " 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . 
pos/cv452_5088.txt the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler . 


pos/cv993_29737.txt

pos/cv993_29737.txt plot : this movie takes place over one day . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt the rookie doesn't know much about " street justice " , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the " real world " . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt how even cops like themselves have to " bend the rules " and " break the law " every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt the film gets right into the " dirty " side of , well . . . the 
pos/cv993_29737.txt dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt and therein , lies the fun of the film . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? 
pos/cv993_29737.txt well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these " commercial " roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt and denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ? 
pos/cv993_29737.txt he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you 
pos/cv993_29737.txt have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major " coincidence " which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too " convenient " for my taste . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . 
pos/cv993_29737.txt in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense ! 
pos/cv993_29737.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv993_29737.txt the corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream ( 8/10 ) - seven ( 10/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - traffic ( 8/10 ) 


pos/cv636_15279.txt

pos/cv636_15279.txt we all know the fate of " child's play , " which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be " bride of chucky " - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt alas , the original " child's play " actually isn't that bad . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , " i know what you did last summer " has recently gone . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt the premise of " child's play " is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , 
pos/cv636_15279.txt there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , " child's play " steers away from that . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! 
pos/cv636_15279.txt that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt if there's anything really wrong with " child's play , " it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt at almost 90 minutes , " child's play " features way too less to be a real classic of horror . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which 
pos/cv636_15279.txt isn't necessarily a bad thing . 
pos/cv636_15279.txt as such , " child's play " is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .

pos/cv708_28729.txt once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt unwittingly befriended by a non-stop talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt his prize ? 
pos/cv708_28729.txt to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad's bride . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in " shrek . " 
pos/cv708_28729.txt it took four writers ( ted elliott and terry rossio ( " the road to el dorado " ) , roger s . h . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt schulman ( " balto " ) and joe stillman ( " beavis and butthead do america " ) ) to adapt william steig's children's book . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the bad news ? 
pos/cv708_28729.txt they've genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman's " the princess bride . " 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the good news ? 
pos/cv708_28729.txt there's so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt we get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of farquaad's men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks' rendition of disney's animated pinocchio . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured 
pos/cv708_28729.txt by farquaad spits icing and yells 'eat me ! ' 
pos/cv708_28729.txt before breaking down and solemnly asking 'do you know the muffin man ? ' 
pos/cv708_28729.txt shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been expecting . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt when fiona's true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the script's details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad's dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and 'it's a small world' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona 'snow white' style . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt popular culture is represented with film references to " babe " and " charlies' angels " via " the matrix . " 
pos/cv708_28729.txt myers chooses his 'so i married an axe murderer' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt eddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney's 'mulan ? ' ) . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious , height-challenged villain lord farquaad . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt  ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who's proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney's " tarzan , " " princess mononoke " and the " south park " movie . ) 
pos/cv708_28729.txt the computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar's work ( " toy story , " " a bug's life , " " toy story 2 " ) . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt in keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer's voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a 'dating game' parody broadcast by snow white's evil queen's mirror , farquaad is told 'fiona likes pina coladas' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt  " shrek " has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family . 
pos/cv708_28729.txt while it may be derivative of the 1987's " the princess bride , " " shrek " addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't suffer in the comparison .

pos/cv324_7082.txt directed by douglas williams 
pos/cv324_7082.txt mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg ) 
pos/cv324_7082.txt though made in canada , " overdrawn at the memory bank " traces its roots to the bbc school of film production . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt caught watching " casablanca " on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to " doppling " rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt  ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess . ) 
pos/cv324_7082.txt as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while 
pos/cv324_7082.txt fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt given that " casablanca " is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to " casablanca " . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called " the place " . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the " schweethaat " -spouting parody seen in cartoons . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as " the fat man " , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with 
pos/cv324_7082.txt less than salutory results . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt words like " dopple " , " psychist " , " computech " , " cinema " , and " reconst " are apparently in common use . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of " virtual reality " today . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it's definitely recommended viewing . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt the music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn't really out of keeping with the genre . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt however , the writing quite makes up for it . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen " casablanca " to appreciate properly . 
pos/cv324_7082.txt all in all , i give " overdrawn at the memory bank " a . 


pos/cv563_17257.txt

pos/cv563_17257.txt in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
pos/cv563_17257.txt exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
pos/cv563_17257.txt midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' 
pos/cv563_17257.txt as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' 
pos/cv563_17257.txt a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt but how realistic are these ideals ? 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe had raped and been raped in texas . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' 
pos/cv563_17257.txt there are two predominant images of new york . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt what has become of joe's american dream ? 
pos/cv563_17257.txt schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . 
pos/cv563_17257.txt an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .
