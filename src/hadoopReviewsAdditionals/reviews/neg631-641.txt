neg/cv428_12202.txt the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt mr . gregg " i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis " araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and how does he show it ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt oh , and it gets better . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of " do you ever wonder what life is all about ? " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt  " the doom generation " is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another " teen angst " film ( one of the slogans is " teen is a four-letter word " - hardy har har ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in " scream " ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in " independence day " ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in " that thing you do ! " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt red , white , and blue ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt huh ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt gregg araki obviously has seen such films as " easy rider , " " natural born killers , " and " kalifornia , " and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt  " the doom generation " doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt she tells him to fuck off or something to that note . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the cash register rings up " 6 . 66 " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt  ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt they say they don't have it . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt wrong . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt when george romero made " dawn of the dead , " a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory " dead alive , " which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in " caligula " ) . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher " peter brady " mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt why are they here ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt so that we can all point to them and say " hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
neg/cv428_12202.txt wow ! " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt gimme a break . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt otherwise defined as " teen angst , " or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt look , i'm 19 years old . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt i've since moved on to " i don't really know what to do with my life " phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! 
neg/cv428_12202.txt what they really need is a reality check . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt hence the title . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? 
neg/cv428_12202.txt if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and if you still don't think that " the doom generation " is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt rose macgowan is horrible . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt yes , she proved herself talented in " scream , " but she's so bad in " the doom generation " that if i had not seen her in " scream , " i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in " that thing you do ! " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and then there's james duval . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him " least talented actor in the world . " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt or at least somewhere up there . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , " heresy " ( example of the lines : " god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there " ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says " fuck . " 
neg/cv428_12202.txt no explanation of this should be necessary . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and finally , a note to gregg : grow up . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt really . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . 
neg/cv428_12202.txt and don't quit it . 


neg/cv269_23018.txt

neg/cv269_23018.txt if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt so do i . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt so i saw " supernova . " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt truth be told , " supernova " wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt maybe i'm becoming a softy . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt in any case , i didn't find " supernova " as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt but it's still bad . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel " nightingale . " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the crew includes captain a . j . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt there are some attempts at " characterization , " but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt have you seen " alien ? " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt have you seen " event horizon " ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt good . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt then you've seen " supernova . " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt but the bigger problem with " supernova " is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt character relationships in this film also make very little sense . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
neg/cv269_23018.txt furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt doesn't make sense . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt not a whit . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt they don't find it . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt sexual tension ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt more like constipation . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as " this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . " 
neg/cv269_23018.txt not that we ever find out who that is , mind you . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt he' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt the rest of the cast does even less . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt tunney stands around looking cute , then scared . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt phillips broods . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt cruz flirts with the computer . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt  " supernova " is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt that's it . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . 
neg/cv269_23018.txt honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? 
neg/cv269_23018.txt it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what " supernova " is .

neg/cv372_6654.txt there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories .

neg/cv372_6654.txt you might like that feeling of cluelessness . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny . 
neg/cv372_6654.txt funny , that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of tarantino's pulp chcaracters .

neg/cv568_17065.txt reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , " analyze this , " i asked myself , " how could this miss ? " 
neg/cv568_17065.txt robert de niro ( " taxi driver , " " raging bull " ) , billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) , lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) , and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon's vacation " ) . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen .

neg/cv568_17065.txt although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won't even admit to having anxiety attacks . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben's potentially happy life gets into danger . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt  " analyze this " has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow's throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt sure , kudrow's fellow " friend " jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in " office space , " but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt once " analyze this " approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . 
neg/cv568_17065.txt  " analyze this " proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn't up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air . 


neg/cv658_11186.txt

neg/cv658_11186.txt senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? 
neg/cv658_11186.txt and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? 
neg/cv658_11186.txt to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt his " intervention " scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt this is a film that desperately needed something else . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . 
neg/cv658_11186.txt as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . 


neg/cv716_11153.txt

neg/cv716_11153.txt synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt the story is told from harry's point of view . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt seduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt turns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt when the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt can he get out of this mess ? 
neg/cv716_11153.txt opinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt towards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession . 
neg/cv716_11153.txt if you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels . 


neg/cv407_23928.txt

neg/cv407_23928.txt gordie boggs ( arquette , aptly cast as a moron , as he is one ) and his best friend sean dawkins ( scott caan . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this ! ) are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends , who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king ( a terribly casted oliver platt ) , as he is everything they are not . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil , ruthless promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff , whose name was written all over the role ! ) . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him , but a drunken , ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry , darryl , and darryl . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt they sneak him back onto wcw tv , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw's next pay-per-view , against his rival , diamond dallas page . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt if he wins , king gets his title and his career back , plus one million dollars . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt wcw president eric bischoff , knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation , came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt he was then fired and rehired two months ago , but by the time he'd left , they had already been contracted to do the film , and bischoff could not play sinclair ( which , in itself , is for the best , as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor ! ) . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt he thinks of them as young , dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt that is why he doesn't take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay-per-view . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt i have news for you , eric : no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn't for show , unless they are four years old . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy , but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic , rocky-style film ( which it probably should have been . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is , why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy ? ) , gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows , documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon's double-crossing of bret hart , will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble , that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince , but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt all of these aspects of the film , needless to say , seriously offended me as a wrestling fan . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan ) . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt wouldn't it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair's insistance ? 
neg/cv407_23928.txt i hate that cliche ! 
neg/cv407_23928.txt the world wrestling federation would have made a better film . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt they are the promotion everyone cares about , they are winning the ratings , they have better wrestlers , and they take their fans into consideration and don't treat fans like morons . 
neg/cv407_23928.txt so , vince , how about a movie ? 


neg/cv884_15230.txt

neg/cv884_15230.txt for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt as a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt generally , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt russell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt the movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we're into todd's later years . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt he's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he's the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie's start . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt between the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt director paul anderson , who helmed last year's icy thriller , event horizon , doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt todd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a " routine patrol " and set the stage for the final firefight . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt events are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt it's not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . 
neg/cv884_15230.txt a strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . 


neg/cv791_17995.txt

neg/cv791_17995.txt this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt using as many methods of murder as they could . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt if not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan . 
neg/cv791_17995.txt friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot . 


neg/cv058_8469.txt

neg/cv058_8469.txt of course i knew this going in . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt they were really original . " 
neg/cv058_8469.txt original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt what does she do ? 
neg/cv058_8469.txt she invents a fiance ! 
neg/cv058_8469.txt then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt he , of course , goes along with it . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt gee , i wonder if they get together in the end . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt i've seen more original stuff on the wb . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt and better stuff too . 
neg/cv058_8469.txt picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .
