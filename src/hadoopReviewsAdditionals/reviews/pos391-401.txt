pos/cv727_4978.txt this " dumb " cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in texas and go to new york . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt when he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn' `stud' in the whol'o' new york city . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt obviously he fails . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt he meets the 'cripple' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this 'rich' dumb cowboy . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt soon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt walking through the city , with " everybody's talkin' " playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico , half-scared , pours out all the money in his pocket . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt 60 filthy cents . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt our cowboy , hungry , is forgiving . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt he is glad he found someone he knows . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico offers to make it up for him . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt and he invites him to his place . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt and what a filthy , cold place it is . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the ( junk ) bed . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt when he finally wakes ( jumps ? ) 
pos/cv727_4978.txt up , he finds rico looking at him . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt  " you wanna cup'a'coffee ? " 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat-childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt  " what're you ? 
pos/cv727_4978.txt a goddamn faggot ? 
pos/cv727_4978.txt what do you want from me ? 
pos/cv727_4978.txt where are my shoes ? 
pos/cv727_4978.txt what did you do to them ? " 
pos/cv727_4978.txt but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico really has a heart . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt together , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt  " we will soon be in miami " is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt the classic theme music : " midnight cowboy " helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film . 
pos/cv727_4978.txt whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable .

pos/cv354_8132.txt i was anxious to see this for a long time . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt scream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , " some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . " 
pos/cv354_8132.txt it's very familar , your typical horror film . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? 
pos/cv354_8132.txt because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt this raises another question : how does it do this ? 
pos/cv354_8132.txt simple : the characters . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , " what door am i at ? " 
pos/cv354_8132.txt and that gets her killed . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt that scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt that and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , " the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . " 
pos/cv354_8132.txt which is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt the cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt also good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( " the fonz " ) as the school principal . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt i took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt i hate that show , i hate those actors . 
pos/cv354_8132.txt they're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't . 


pos/cv667_18467.txt

pos/cv667_18467.txt the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt we're the fans , not the freaks . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt all right , stop looking at me like that . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt we have been faithfully and patiently waiting . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt unfortunately , it is not our savior . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt character development is virtually nonexistent . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt his speech mannerisms are so " cute-ified " that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as " deep doo doo , " and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a " wretched hive of scum and villainy . " 
pos/cv667_18467.txt in the phantom menace , we get doo doo . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story " a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . " 
pos/cv667_18467.txt this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? 
pos/cv667_18467.txt the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? 
pos/cv667_18467.txt didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? 
pos/cv667_18467.txt didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? 
pos/cv667_18467.txt of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film's release . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn't have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body's cells . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt don't let me mislead you too far . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . 
pos/cv667_18467.txt it's just that when held up to it's predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . 


pos/cv756_22540.txt

pos/cv756_22540.txt while screen adaptations of john irving's novels have been disappointingly uneven , the films have all shared one particular strength : key casting . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon , the transsexual quarterback of " the world according to garp , " or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in " the hotel new hampshire " ? 
pos/cv756_22540.txt a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of " the cider house rules , " an adaptation of irving's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role ; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure , dr . wilbur larch , the ether-addicted head obstetrician of the st . cloud's orphanage , maine ; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st . cloud's , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt there's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt am i forgetting anyone ? 
pos/cv756_22540.txt yes . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt kieran culkin and paz de la huerta as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every time they're on the screen . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt but with " the cider house rules , " the good people decisions don't end with the cast . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt irving has written his own screenplay in order to get it right this time ( last year's " simon birch , " loosely based on his " a prayer for owen meaney , " was a big-screen example of irving handled sub-standardly ) ; the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt rachel portman , a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness , provides a score that's absolutely right for the project--sweet , lyrical , and tender . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt there's impressive new england photography by oliver stapleton too . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt last but by no means least is " my life as a dog " director lasse hallstr ? m , who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and helping bring irving's marvelously touching story to life . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt for the many beloved who pass away in " the cider house rules , " it's an extraordinarily life-affirming story . 
pos/cv756_22540.txt and now , thanks to these talented individuals , it's an extraordinarily life-affirming film . 


pos/cv077_22138.txt

pos/cv077_22138.txt blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt where do vampires get money ? 
pos/cv077_22138.txt well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . 
pos/cv077_22138.txt very cool . 


pos/cv083_24234.txt

pos/cv083_24234.txt after having heard so many critics describe " return to me " as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? 
pos/cv083_24234.txt what made " return to me " old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? 
pos/cv083_24234.txt was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? 
pos/cv083_24234.txt was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the charisma of the two leads ? 
pos/cv083_24234.txt even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- " return to me " was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt it was traditional , magical . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the " return to me " ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt >from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt  " return to me " has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father .

pos/cv083_24234.txt disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of " the x-files . " 
pos/cv083_24234.txt duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt while " return to me " functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt we already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt however , in the spirit of " return to me , " it won't do to be too picky about how " old " hollywood tells its stories .

pos/cv083_24234.txt it shows . 
pos/cv083_24234.txt the bottom line : " return to me " is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined .

pos/cv397_29023.txt in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural " rush hour " - to the tune of about $250 million . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in " rush hour 2 . " 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in " rush hour " that played well to audiences around the world . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt surprisingly , " rush hour 2 " wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the makers of " rush hour 2 " are working at a distinct advantage over the original . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in " rush hour . " 
pos/cv397_29023.txt first and foremost to me , in " rh2 , " is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the " lethal weapon " films . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to " get lee and carter , " but gives the chief bad guy elegance . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt zhang zi-yi ( " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt  ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) 
pos/cv397_29023.txt roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt director ratner and the original " rush hour " production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives " rh2 " the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt the rest of the techs are of the same high quality . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt i'm surprised to even say that " rush hour 2 " is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . 
pos/cv397_29023.txt it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer .

pos/cv608_23231.txt magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose " search and destroy " seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it is not a pleasant movie . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt there is not one bad note in the acting . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it is affecting and layered and wonderful . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt the problem is that he stays on them too long . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt and just what is the theme ? 
pos/cv608_23231.txt alienation ? 
pos/cv608_23231.txt hopelessness ? 
pos/cv608_23231.txt anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! 
pos/cv608_23231.txt what's surprising is that it mostly works . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt my rating : a bulleye . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt  ( stars ) 
pos/cv608_23231.txt a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . 
pos/cv608_23231.txt when she sings " save me " at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as " wise up " mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .

pos/cv181_14401.txt i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't " natural " . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a " normal " son . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt the cast is excellent . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . 
pos/cv181_14401.txt take your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . 


pos/cv655_11154.txt

pos/cv655_11154.txt jacques tati's 1953 classic " les vacances de m . hulot " ( also known as " mr . hulot's vacation , " in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt in " les vacances de m . hulot , " the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and " les vacances de m . hulot " succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , " oh , he's not going to do that again , " but , lo and behold , he does . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt  " les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt note : " les vacances de m . hulot " was not rated by the mpaa . 
pos/cv655_11154.txt it would at most receive a pg rating .
