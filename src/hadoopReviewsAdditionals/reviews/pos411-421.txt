pos/cv375_9929.txt there's a moment in schindler's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt one girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt it is probably the finest moment through out the film . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt when i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not say why . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt at another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e . t . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt -- but it wasn't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt the product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt we watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt the film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment and you'll be bitterly dissapointed . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt it does reward the patient viewer . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt this eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt it leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt afterwards you can reflect on individual images , visions , and people . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt laconic , removed , schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all , does much , and leaves feeling as if he could , should , have done more then he did and was able to . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt the change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker , it would be crude and would cheat the audience . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt instead we are told a tale , told a story . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt the film is punishing to watch , yes . 
pos/cv375_9929.txt but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie .

pos/cv342_19456.txt

pos/cv342_19456.txt the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of " science fiction , " stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt something bad happens to them . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt apparently everyone in the town is dead . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt the authorities call a " wildfire alert , " summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a " directive 712 , " an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt they barely call off the bombing in time . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . 
pos/cv342_19456.txt it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . 


pos/cv335_14665.txt

pos/cv335_14665.txt jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt instead , he asks who the ghost is . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt only paul d is suspicious of the stranger . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt _beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . 
pos/cv335_14665.txt taken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . 


pos/cv129_16741.txt

pos/cv129_16741.txt the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a " saturday night live " spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first " artsy " film . 
pos/cv129_16741.txt life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . 


pos/cv140_7479.txt

pos/cv140_7479.txt the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : " it mu5t be found . " 
pos/cv140_7479.txt so what , exactly , is the fifth element ? 
pos/cv140_7479.txt after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the " enemy " --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . 
pos/cv140_7479.txt it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . 


pos/cv032_22550.txt

pos/cv032_22550.txt as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt  " in the heat of the night " was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt preceding the very original " a soldier's story " and the recently released " the hurricane , " " in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt however , unlike " the hurricane " where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he would refer to tibbs as " boy " and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt  " in the heat of the night " shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt it displays this perfectly . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt  ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . 
pos/cv032_22550.txt he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , " in the heat of the night " and the even better " in cold blood . " )

pos/cv041_21113.txt with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt lester works for an advertising agency . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt but inside she is desperate . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt in fact they are the next door neighbors . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in " american beauty " . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series " cybil " and creator of the new sitcom " oh grow up " , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt not one character in this film rings falsely . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as " the graduate " or " lolita " . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .

pos/cv041_21113.txt her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt she is the prototypical trophy child .

pos/cv041_21113.txt thora birch is a young actress to watch . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt colonel finn is a man in complete denial . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt every nuance of " american beauty " begs it's audience to think and examine . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . 
pos/cv041_21113.txt and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . 


pos/cv248_13987.txt

pos/cv248_13987.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt  ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) 
pos/cv248_13987.txt while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out ) . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt it's also vastly more convincing with its argument . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt  " mathematics is the language of the universe , " insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt it helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt still , we do care about max's fate . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt it's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt  ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) 
pos/cv248_13987.txt using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt pi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt the film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt at one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt computer chip . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt  " isn't it beautiful , " she coos . 
pos/cv248_13987.txt a showcase for mr . aronofsky's technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year .

pos/cv957_8737.txt capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt roars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt to talk about jackie chan as a " stuntman " is to miss a million things . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there , copping a look . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt supercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt it's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt  ( the others are also worth seeing . ) 
pos/cv957_8737.txt it's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it's a field day . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt there's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt the drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt this means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that's one of the movie's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt action . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) 
pos/cv957_8737.txt outrunning the hong kong coast guard . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt there is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the 'copter as well as a motorcycle . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt you get the idea . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt watch it with friends . 
pos/cv957_8737.txt when they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer .
