pos/cv189_22934.txt part one of " the strangest movies ever made " series at www . mediajunkies . com 
pos/cv189_22934.txt by scott watson 
pos/cv189_22934.txt [light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] 
pos/cv189_22934.txt existenz has been called " a gooey matrix " , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , " real " reality . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt a major difference is that " the matrix " has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt and oh what a reality it is . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt technology is organic , but only some of it . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt cars are normal . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt gas stations are the same . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt cell phones are glowing bug like appendages . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a " pod " ) . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt she is on the run ( from who , i'm still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with " someone friendly " . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( " it's a sign of the times " ) . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt but the plot , while cohesive in it's own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt cronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it's up to you to figure out how all these things work . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt and that's the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt there's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station's name appears to be " gas " . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt it all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix's virtual world . . . 
pos/cv189_22934.txt oh wait , i already do . 


pos/cv542_18980.txt

pos/cv542_18980.txt don't let the following quirks of this review , fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that ? 
pos/cv542_18980.txt life is beautiful , even though i'm a short , ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt life is beautiful even though i haven't amounted to much in life , except working out the finer intricacies of waitering . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt i'm a lucky sort of a guy , especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age , sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful ! 
pos/cv542_18980.txt i'm a jew , but life can still be beautiful . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt i love my son very much and that's what matters , and that's what makes life beautiful . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ? 
pos/cv542_18980.txt i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love , but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing - so by jove don't give me any crap about it ! 
pos/cv542_18980.txt by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved . 
pos/cv542_18980.txt well done , there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni . 


pos/cv548_17731.txt

pos/cv548_17731.txt synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt after uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt it is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt this film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt for those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt nicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt as tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt california , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt the real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt stormare played the " really , really evil guy " in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt his performance is very chilling . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt 8 mm's success may hardly be surprising . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt it was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt before directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt 8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt 8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt welles is searching for answers . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? 
pos/cv548_17731.txt when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt he just enjoys it . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt that , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt yes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt second , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt he discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt finally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt despite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt he pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt he then leaves the building and calls the victim's mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt the entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt rarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt 8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt this is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . 
pos/cv548_17731.txt if you're prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . 


pos/cv642_29867.txt

pos/cv642_29867.txt plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt critique : awesome ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so 
pos/cv642_29867.txt yes , i really dug this movie ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is 
pos/cv642_29867.txt very serious ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective " kill scenes " , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and " feel " of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those " unfortunates " ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel " from hell " written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? 
pos/cv642_29867.txt yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little " love " story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt that's right , there's no real need to put any " romance " in a film about a mass murderer ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't ) . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc . . . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters . . . or 
pos/cv642_29867.txt am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? 
pos/cv642_29867.txt perhaps . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt but it's not for everyone . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . 
pos/cv642_29867.txt but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper's haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! 
pos/cv642_29867.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv642_29867.txt the crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) 


pos/cv433_10144.txt

pos/cv433_10144.txt quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt that is , until now . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt i will tread lightly . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt for a hefty price . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the " leaps " in time . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel " rum punch " by elmore leonard . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt but no matter . . . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackson is very strong in his role . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt when compared , it comes up short , but not that short . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . 
pos/cv433_10144.txt expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) .

pos/cv692_15451.txt making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt and whereas " babe : pig in the city " misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like " the godfather : part ii " and " the empire strikes back " as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " picks up precisely where " babe " left off . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " flourishes where so many sequels fail . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt not " babe : pig in the city " . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt and it succeeds . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt that's not to say the familiar is absent . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new " urbanites " that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt the greatest triumph of " babe : pig in the city " is the art direction . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt it is a world that you want to walk around in . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of " babe : pig in the city " . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt by deleting a minimal number of shots , " babe : pig in the city " was eventually given the coveted g rating . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt well , to coin a phrase , the reports of " babe : pig in the city " 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all " babe : pig in the city " is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt whatever " dark " moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the " mad max " trilogy , " the witches of eastwick " , " lorenzo's oil " ) . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt the story of " babe : pig in the city " is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe " dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between " babe : pig in the city " being a very good film and the original being a great one . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt as an overall piece , " babe : pig in the city " is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt  " babe : pig in the city " may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . 
pos/cv692_15451.txt as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .

pos/cv918_2693.txt wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? 
pos/cv918_2693.txt somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! 
pos/cv918_2693.txt still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of " nothing counts as much as blood . " 
pos/cv918_2693.txt equally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) 
pos/cv918_2693.txt sequence that is decidedly non-pc . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt don't look for much glorified violence here . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt despite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt kevin costner is very good in the title role . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt he was tougher in a perfect world . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt his foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt gaunt * and * gamely , he's a scene stealer who's seen too little . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt other familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt though the story and score should've tried " less is more , " all other credits are technical tops . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt production designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must've been an enormous budget . 
pos/cv918_2693.txt clearly no expense was spared .

pos/cv894_2068.txt carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california .

pos/cv894_2068.txt dan gauthier , gugino's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son-in-law is the film to see this summer . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt the cast for this film does an excellent job . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt patrick renna , who played gugino's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt tiffani-amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , " saved by the bell " ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television . 
pos/cv894_2068.txt she wasn't given overly much to do in the film , but what she had , she does a good job with . 


pos/cv928_9168.txt

pos/cv928_9168.txt i swear i have seen the edge before . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt for once , we don't immediately care for the main character . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his " personality . " 
pos/cv928_9168.txt charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt my favorite line of the film comes from charles : " most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt thinking . " 
pos/cv928_9168.txt despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? 
pos/cv928_9168.txt i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt the edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . 
pos/cv928_9168.txt some of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me .
