neg/cv699_7773.txt okay , i just don't know why , but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . . . as 
neg/cv699_7773.txt well as real-life acting tim allen movies . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt i couldn't even make it through " the santa clause , " so why did i even see this ? 
neg/cv699_7773.txt  ( just to make an idle point , i did like " toy story , " but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt well , this is my excuse : it was prom night , i'm not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing " grosse pointe blank " - wouldn't mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt i agreed to go . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt ugh . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn't dreamed by an american . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of " little indian , big city " ( french title - " un indien dans la ville " ) . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt i stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing 
neg/cv699_7773.txt  ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good ) . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . . . or 
neg/cv699_7773.txt as the bad joke goes - " mitsubishi " - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you 
neg/cv699_7773.txt know the drill . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt now this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn't able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! ) 
neg/cv699_7773.txt tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt the story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn't help it . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt the whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt at the end of filming , did they all scream out , " we've made a great movie , guys ! " 
neg/cv699_7773.txt i sure hope not . 
neg/cv699_7773.txt big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they're just going to do it the exact same way ? 
neg/cv699_7773.txt huh ? 
neg/cv699_7773.txt my ( for some of the actors' names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . . . okay , 
neg/cv699_7773.txt so i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star )

neg/cv667_19672.txt  " the red violin " is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt  " the red violin " could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt girard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt it's resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt nor are any of the performances memorable . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt it's as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt  " the red violin " promises much , but delivers little . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt it is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt the movie's music soars over its story and performers . 
neg/cv667_19672.txt and that is its only saving grace . 


neg/cv386_10229.txt

neg/cv386_10229.txt some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt magoo being a prime example . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt mr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt magoo can only be described as painfully bad . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt mr . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt magoo provides only three such moments . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt he said he liked home alone 3 much more . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . 
neg/cv386_10229.txt his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .

neg/cv486_9788.txt where do i begin ? 
neg/cv486_9788.txt okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years . . . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt or even a decade . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt this is bad beyond belief . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt i would * not * suggest paying money to see this . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt there's a good chance you'll regret it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt go right ahead . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of . . . buenos aires . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt before long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt they train . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt after an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt the big bugs look nice , even though their design is only " okay . " 
neg/cv486_9788.txt unfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt cue more agony . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt then some characters have sex . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt then some more die . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt  * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * 
neg/cv486_9788.txt cue more agony . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt the movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt unfortunately , after that torture , they can't think straight , don't pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt you remember how batman & robin was bad ? 
neg/cv486_9788.txt well , batman & robin kicked this movie's sorry butt , people . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it does not succeed as a drama . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it does not succeed as a war movie . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it does not succeed as a comedy . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it does not succeed as a satire . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it does not succeed as a parody . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it succeeds as being horrible . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt terrible . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt gut-wrenchingly bad . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt i wanted to run away from that movie every minute . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt so i stayed . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it never got better . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt the movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it's about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 . the whole thing feels like a movie that only three-year-olds could enjoy . . . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt it's written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt of course , i recommend the same for everyone . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt don't go anywhere near it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt verhoeven's got a streak going now . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt his last movie was showgirls . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt showgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it'll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross-wise . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt is it really * all * bad ? 
neg/cv486_9788.txt well , no . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the " do you want to know more ? " 
neg/cv486_9788.txt commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt i'm totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt but i do admit it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt so , if you're willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt i don't know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt feel free to give it a shot . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don't recommend it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt but guess what ? 
neg/cv486_9788.txt alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it'll be difficult to find someone that * won't * like alien resurrection when they've seen it . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt this is possibly the year's best intense action film , or at least * one * of the best . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt if you really want to see alien warfare that's played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection . 
neg/cv486_9788.txt please , avoid this . 


neg/cv538_28485.txt

neg/cv538_28485.txt movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt so , undoubtedly one day someone said , " 'evolution ? ' 
neg/cv538_28485.txt it's 'ghostbusters' plus 'men in black' plus 'tremors . ' " 
neg/cv538_28485.txt and so it is . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt sum total none . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon , arizona . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt community college science profs ira kane ( david duchovny ) and harry block ( orlando jones ) take some samples from the meteor and discover that one-celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly , doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt just about the time i was wondering , " hey , doesn't the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies , " the government came in and took over the whole area . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt the leader of the pack , gen . woodman ( ted levine ) , turns out to be an old nemesis of ira's , and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt meanwhile , the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt by this time , ira and harry have gained a friend in dr . allison reed ( julianne moore ) of the center for disease control . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt a country club poolboy , wayne green ( seann william scott ) , has also attached himself to the merry band . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time ? 
neg/cv538_28485.txt director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984's " ghostbusters , " but " evolution " falls miserably short . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt one reason is readily apparent . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt  " ghostbusters " had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but " evolution " has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else's hands . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt for good measure , " ghostbusters " had the comic talents of rick moranis ; " evolution " offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in " american pie " and " road trip " than he is here . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt scott has one amusing scene where he sings " you are so beautiful to me " to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt other than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt an actor in search of a forte , david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in " playing god " and his romantic side in " return to me . " 
neg/cv538_28485.txt now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent ; what we all find is that he doesn't have any . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt look for him to be back on tv in five years or so . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt another sad case is julianne moore , who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt she's a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations , so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy ? 
neg/cv538_28485.txt her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things , but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt the sole saving grace of the film is jones . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt he's at the center of the movie's funniest scene -- where an alien bug invades harry's body and has to be pulled out through his ass . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it , but he can't carry the whole movie by himself . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt he found himself in a similar situation in " the replacements , " where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast . 
neg/cv538_28485.txt jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star , but this isn't it .

neg/cv756_23676.txt jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt let's find out . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt critique : three words : not enough action ! 
neg/cv756_23676.txt simple enough ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt and a romance angle ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt why , one must ask . . . why ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? 
neg/cv756_23676.txt what a letdown . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the " hits " for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called " screenplay " . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? ! 
neg/cv756_23676.txt what a mess . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! 
neg/cv756_23676.txt the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn't save the rest of this film's uninteresting plot movements . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt i'm disappointed for jet li that this film didn't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . 
neg/cv756_23676.txt for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film's title isn't a premonition of the movie's ultimate fate at the box-office .

neg/cv580_15681.txt flik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt banished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt  " a bug's life , " has one thing going for it . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt only one thing . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt with its glorious , bright colors , the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt the film itself , unfortunately , is a lifeless , unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of , " toy story . " 
neg/cv580_15681.txt the characters in , " a bug's life , " are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality , other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes , and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout , and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year , i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them , but then i realized this is just not so . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt i still adore almost all of the older disney films , and many of the newer ones , such as 1989's , " the little mermaid , " 1991's , " beauty and the beast , " 1993's , " the nightmare before christmas , " and yes , 1995's , " toy story . " 
neg/cv580_15681.txt maybe this has just been a bad year for children's films , and hopefully , the upcoming , " the prince of egypt , " will not be a disappointment . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt as for , " a bug's life , " i did not enjoy anything about it . 
neg/cv580_15681.txt not the story , not the characters , and not even the voiceover work , which was far more lively in , " antz . " 
neg/cv580_15681.txt  " a bug's life , " goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , " i'll be home for christmas . "

neg/cv729_10475.txt as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt this is there strictly for the kids . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? 
neg/cv729_10475.txt this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof . brainard's flying robot weebo . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt now , weebo is a totally different story . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt it's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt this is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt the acting by robin williams ( prof . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt people when stood up at the altar , don't usually give third chances . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children's movie . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt flubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not wash up to the original . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie . 
neg/cv729_10475.txt as a movie it's just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that . 


neg/cv172_12037.txt

neg/cv172_12037.txt watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
neg/cv172_12037.txt there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt the sound and screen kicked ass . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt i even liked the computer-generated settings . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt william hurt isn't too bad either . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt that type of moviemaking is a lost art . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt now for the bad news . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt  " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' " 
neg/cv172_12037.txt then there's the tone of the movie . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt then it could be an adventure movie . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt why ? 
neg/cv172_12037.txt why bother saying what year this is . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt just tell us it's the future . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . 
neg/cv172_12037.txt still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards . 


neg/cv460_11723.txt

neg/cv460_11723.txt the word to describe sharon stone is " wonder " . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt not that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt she has a dynamic screen presence in " basic instinct " , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in " casino " , but possesses neither of those here . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to' [read " steal from " ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe . . . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt it's stone that is a disappointment among the actors . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? 
neg/cv460_11723.txt costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . 
neg/cv460_11723.txt that is if you can put up with stone's cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies .
