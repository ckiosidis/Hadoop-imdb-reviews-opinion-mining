pos/cv864_3416.txt after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt she is often the target of her father's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel's wedding unfolds from there . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt muriel's father , bill " the battler " heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt while chumming around with young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel's cheeky new friend in the film . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting 
pos/cv864_3416.txt muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . 
pos/cv864_3416.txt on my four star scale , i give muriel's wedding three stars .

pos/cv116_28942.txt capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt i had a good time . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt  , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv116_28942.txt here goes my credibility . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt i liked the third jurassic park film . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt i even liked the second jurassic park film . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , " for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . " 
pos/cv116_28942.txt that is what all the jurassic park films are . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt i feel i got my money's worth . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt right . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt guess what happens next ? 
pos/cv116_28942.txt jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt sometimes they just move too fast to see . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . 
pos/cv116_28942.txt i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


pos/cv468_15228.txt

pos/cv468_15228.txt when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt  ( " all i've ever known to be true is a lie , " moses complains . ) 
pos/cv468_15228.txt after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt this awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt the prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . 
pos/cv468_15228.txt how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it . 


pos/cv766_7540.txt

pos/cv766_7540.txt quiz show , an almost perfectly accurate true story , is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid-50's , " twenty-one " . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt on this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt and your jewish man raising a family . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt stempel has been the reigning champion on " twenty-one " for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a " jewish guy from queens with bad teeth " and that the kids need someone better to look up to . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt van doren had decided to try out for the game show " tic tac dough " because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the " twenty-one " kingdom . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt after stempel loses the " throne " to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt meanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on " twenty-one " to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt quiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford's direction is especially superb . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt the performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . 
pos/cv766_7540.txt definitely a film you should not miss .

pos/cv499_10658.txt towards the middle of " the sweet hereafter , " a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt it pauses for a moment before the " field " cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of " titanic , " when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt the scene in " the sweet hereafter " epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt it's not sensational . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt stephens , who " doesn't believe in accidents , " functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for " the ice storm , " contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt  " the sweet hereafter , " while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go . 
pos/cv499_10658.txt it's a film of generous subtlety and emotion . 


pos/cv206_14293.txt

pos/cv206_14293.txt you've got to love disney . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt kids have to go see the movie . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt then they have to get the toys . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt oh , the video came out ? 
pos/cv206_14293.txt got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
pos/cv206_14293.txt buy a disney t-shirt ! 
pos/cv206_14293.txt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
pos/cv206_14293.txt it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt dale carnegie should have had it so good . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that " grace " is not one of her strong points . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt you have to hear it to understand . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically " disneyfied " ethnic tale . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt it just left me thinking , " that was really cool . " 
pos/cv206_14293.txt a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt i found the choice of b . d . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt in any event , wong performs admirably as well . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a " miss saigon " -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . 
pos/cv206_14293.txt this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .

pos/cv646_15065.txt vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt  ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) 
pos/cv646_15065.txt blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a " master " ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt luckily , he's got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . 
pos/cv646_15065.txt certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters .

pos/cv630_10057.txt king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt beaumarchais was the author of the plays , " the barber of seville " and " the marriage of figaro . " 
pos/cv630_10057.txt today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship .

pos/cv630_10057.txt although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style .

pos/cv630_10057.txt one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him . 
pos/cv630_10057.txt the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time .

pos/cv005_29443.txt on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in " lumumba . " 
pos/cv005_29443.txt patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , " lumumba - death of a prophet , " virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt  ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt some colonial masters were better than others . ) 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt  " lumumba " is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . 
pos/cv005_29443.txt it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . 


pos/cv254_6027.txt

pos/cv254_6027.txt curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt to be specific , let me give you an example . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? 
pos/cv254_6027.txt if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt one particularly striking m . o . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt no points for guessing what they do . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt it's a great performance . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . 
pos/cv254_6027.txt it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well .
