neg/cv278_14533.txt it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt both those films were tense exercises in chills . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the thrills all came from the plot . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt ronin is like a film made by another man . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt if you miss the opening , do not worry . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt this film will explain again what a ronin is . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the story is not very easy to follow . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt some very good actors are involved in this film . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt one wonders what they saw in the script . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . 
neg/cv278_14533.txt this is the first blow of the 47 ronin . 


neg/cv341_25667.txt

neg/cv341_25667.txt you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and 
neg/cv341_25667.txt it's not a comedy ! 
neg/cv341_25667.txt and what a strange career path for director chuck russell . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt he starts his career off with a decent take on the " nightmare on elm street " series with his debut as director on installment number three . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt so then he thought , " let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes " ? ! ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt strange dude and one crappy flick . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl's aunt wants to . . . well , 
neg/cv341_25667.txt save her from those damn devil worshippers ! 
neg/cv341_25667.txt enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you've just about got the gist of things here . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt what's good about this movie ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film's entire basis of believability . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is 
neg/cv341_25667.txt a dumb one ! 
neg/cv341_25667.txt add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you've got yourself a pretty bad movie . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt did they owe the director a favor or something ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of " sneaking up " on a man's house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! 
neg/cv341_25667.txt uuuhmm . . . how's 
neg/cv341_25667.txt about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! 
neg/cv341_25667.txt anyway , i don't usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt and did basinger lose some of her acting " talent " during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? 
neg/cv341_25667.txt difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film . 
neg/cv341_25667.txt but if you really don't mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and " kid " -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don't bring anything new to the table . . . well , 
neg/cv341_25667.txt drink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year . 


neg/cv243_22164.txt

neg/cv243_22164.txt i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt film is a different medium . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt it is a visual medium . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the magazine article and the film script are two very different media . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article " the man who knew too much " by marie brenner . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt it really verges on being tedious at least at times . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? 
neg/cv243_22164.txt that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt and in the end , he failed . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt and so the game begins . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . 
neg/cv243_22164.txt i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv721_28993.txt

neg/cv721_28993.txt tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt i didn't expect much from this latest " interpretation " of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those " damn dirty apes , " in one of his best roles of his career ? 
neg/cv721_28993.txt sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered " smart " chimps into the storms to collect data . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! 
neg/cv721_28993.txt in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the " surprise " ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt even joel schumacher could have directed this film . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt he probably should have . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt burton's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . 
neg/cv721_28993.txt i suppose that's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole . 


neg/cv731_3968.txt

neg/cv731_3968.txt we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer's character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an " a . " 
neg/cv731_3968.txt that's fair enough . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt the chance to succeed . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt yeah right . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt children fail , as do films . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt as does director john boorman's latest . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt she's a lightweight . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt as the first scene ( with narration ! ) 
neg/cv731_3968.txt demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt empty exoticism . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt also odd is the obvious dubbing . 
neg/cv731_3968.txt done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ? 
neg/cv731_3968.txt and , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ?

neg/cv786_23608.txt  " mission to mars " is one of those annoying movies where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt  " mission " * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it's too little , too late . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt  " mission " has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt i'm sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt glances don't communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then we're so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt great design , good intentions , but no cigar . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt if you're not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , don't waste your eight bucks on this . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt and what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . 
neg/cv786_23608.txt that's just unforgiveable .

neg/cv941_10718.txt the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth " bumpy " johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt bloody gang warfare ensues .

neg/cv941_10718.txt his new army questions his methods . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt his girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt this movie is not original at all . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
neg/cv941_10718.txt here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) .

neg/cv941_10718.txt the setup in this movie is done rather well . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of " runners " sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
neg/cv941_10718.txt some of the individual performances were well done . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in " the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover " and " rob roy " . 
neg/cv941_10718.txt the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows .

neg/cv213_20300.txt in " the astronaut's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary's species . " 
neg/cv213_20300.txt what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt ok , maybe " the astronaut's wife " deviates from " rosemary's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . " 
neg/cv213_20300.txt theron's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt  " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt last year's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt  " the astronaut's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in " big daddy . " 
neg/cv213_20300.txt draw your own conclusions . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . " 
neg/cv213_20300.txt cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt instead , he adds to the phoniness . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . " 
neg/cv213_20300.txt undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt in space , no one can hear you scream . 
neg/cv213_20300.txt but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore . 


neg/cv024_7033.txt

neg/cv024_7033.txt forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 
neg/cv024_7033.txt surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? 
neg/cv024_7033.txt the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . 
neg/cv024_7033.txt far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience .
