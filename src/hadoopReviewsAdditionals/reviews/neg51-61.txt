neg/cv079_12766.txt over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor " animal " palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt he didn't . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt the script , however , is painfully bad . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , " you idiot , " or " you stupid girl . " 
neg/cv079_12766.txt i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? 
neg/cv079_12766.txt why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? 
neg/cv079_12766.txt why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? 
neg/cv079_12766.txt why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? 
neg/cv079_12766.txt okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt casting must have been asleep on this one . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? 
neg/cv079_12766.txt if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! 
neg/cv079_12766.txt there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt consider another punch pulled . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt it made me want to gag . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . 
neg/cv079_12766.txt now if they only had raymond burr . . . . 


neg/cv831_16325.txt

neg/cv831_16325.txt one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? 
neg/cv831_16325.txt i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ? " 
neg/cv831_16325.txt as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . 
neg/cv831_16325.txt although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's " casino " or 1996's " last dance " if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . 


neg/cv694_4526.txt

neg/cv694_4526.txt if you've seen the trailers or commercials , it's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt well , it's hard to tell after watching the movie as well . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt bruce willis is a resident of the future , and it is a rather bleak future . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt the world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200 , 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt the reason ? 
neg/cv694_4526.txt in 1995 , an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus , thus wiping out practically the world's population in a mere month . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt bruce willis' character is one of the surviving few , but is enslaved by scientists , as are most of last living humans . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task : go into the past , find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys , and kill him . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt well , this explanation didn't come easy . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people , our future and the evilo in the world , as a story it is very confusing . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt and dragging . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt i know a movie isn''t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it's only been an hour passed . 
neg/cv694_4526.txt terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate , and i haven't watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me . 


neg/cv921_13988.txt

neg/cv921_13988.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt be forewarned . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt and with good reason . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt  ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) 
neg/cv921_13988.txt uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt  ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) 
neg/cv921_13988.txt overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt mr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt at least it all looks good . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt by the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . 
neg/cv921_13988.txt there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not .

neg/cv512_17618.txt plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt naturally , this got me worried . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? 
neg/cv512_17618.txt if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) 
neg/cv512_17618.txt hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt also , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt the story is a bit of a mess , frankly . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt she looks nice , though . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt but production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . 
neg/cv512_17618.txt although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel .

neg/cv512_17618.txt although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite .

neg/cv746_10471.txt the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
neg/cv746_10471.txt dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt  * * * the review * * * 
neg/cv746_10471.txt released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to " fold space " and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt what a great idea ! 
neg/cv746_10471.txt why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt dune is also a very serous film . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the constant " self-talk " by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt see it in the widescreen format if you can . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the conclusion ? 
neg/cv746_10471.txt any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition " director's cut " of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with " allen smithee " , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous " judas booth " . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his " heart plug " . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the " alan smithee " version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . 
neg/cv746_10471.txt with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga .

neg/cv989_17297.txt as the sexual acts take place , the other guys hang out nearby , guzzling beer and grunting like pigs . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt in the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt only amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt as rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt the director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt her fellow students delight in tormenting her . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt of course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt as the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt rachel's girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made " love " to her the night before spurns her . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt  ( he gets major points in his black book for this , but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death . ) 
neg/cv989_17297.txt even a helpless puppy is run over , and we see his poor , little body flipping over and over under a truck .

neg/cv989_17297.txt responds his nonplussed girlfriend . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt  " she wasn't anybody . " 
neg/cv989_17297.txt remarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt with material this bad , the film's only hope is to go for parody , but it isn't smart enough to realize it . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt the rage : carrie 2 runs 1 : 45 . 
neg/cv989_17297.txt it is rated r for graphic violence , teen alcohol abuse , sex , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers . 


neg/cv886_19210.txt

neg/cv886_19210.txt i am continually amazed at movies like this . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt  " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt talk about deeply developed characters . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the year is 1869 . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt president grant sends west and gordon to investigate . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt as i said , the fault is totally that of the script . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! " 
neg/cv886_19210.txt sound good . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt still , this film has a lot going for it visually . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half-way point . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt if " wild wild west " didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining . 
neg/cv886_19210.txt it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy . 


neg/cv218_25651.txt

neg/cv218_25651.txt  " american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer's attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt it's about an a+ student ( biggs as " paul " ) who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora ( suvari ) a ditzy heroin-chic goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick-boy " paul is . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt so we've got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it's as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt there's no background or details to anyone or anything , it's just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt not to mention the story itself which is virtually non-existant and contains so many plotholes it's like swiss cheese . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt even the basic editing is bad . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt if you're looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all . 
neg/cv218_25651.txt if you've seen the commericials you've seen all the " funny " parts ( which are all from the first five minutes ) .
