pos/cv477_22479.txt if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) 
pos/cv477_22479.txt spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . ) 
pos/cv477_22479.txt writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt what ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt the result is a central character that is immediately appealing . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt at times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? 
pos/cv477_22479.txt fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt the slave trade . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt fanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she " married for love . " 
pos/cv477_22479.txt fanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt the spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt marriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt in the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt  " and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? " 
pos/cv477_22479.txt matthew 19 : 5 [kjv] 
pos/cv477_22479.txt love and logic can be combined . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt god's word contains both . 
pos/cv477_22479.txt so does a marriage based upon his truth .

pos/cv771_28665.txt in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in " thirteen days . " 
pos/cv771_28665.txt one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called " missiles of october " that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller " no way out " ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt where " thirteen days " differs most from " missiles of october " is , as expected , in the scope of the project . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt it shows as the makers of " thirteen days " craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the meat of " thirteen days " is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt costner , as ken o'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt kevin conway gives his general lemay the right " bomb them to hell " attitude . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o'donnell's admonition , " don' get shot . " 
pos/cv771_28665.txt tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt it's an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . 
pos/cv771_28665.txt i give " thirteen days " an a- . 


pos/cv156_10481.txt

pos/cv156_10481.txt with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? 
pos/cv156_10481.txt based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt 3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . 
pos/cv156_10481.txt easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .

pos/cv670_25826.txt whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the scary thing is that it's actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the crew works for several reasons . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four " past their prime " wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their " golden paradise " by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey " bats " pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike " the brick " donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony " mouth " donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt this " simple plan " suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who's convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt instead of concentrating on bobby's search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character's uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa . 
pos/cv670_25826.txt in the steady flow of " extreme " comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it's the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting .

pos/cv760_8597.txt the " italian hitchcock " and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school's population terrified . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist ( donald pleasance ) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt phenomena is an imaginative , original thriller . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt writer/director argento creates several sequences of surreal , haunting beauty here , including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer's beckoning . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer's identity is genuinely shocking and surprising . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex-rolling stone bill wyman , and argento's favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt but it gels surprisingly well . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt the film's opening music reccurs several times , an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt argento fans beware : the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re-titled as creepers . 
pos/cv760_8597.txt this deleted nearly half an hour of footage , mainly of key dialogue scenes . 


pos/cv035_3954.txt

pos/cv035_3954.txt unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he " couldn't care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . " 
pos/cv035_3954.txt despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . 
pos/cv035_3954.txt when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . 


pos/cv002_15918.txt

pos/cv002_15918.txt you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? 
pos/cv002_15918.txt if you like something so much , why even question it ? 
pos/cv002_15918.txt again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . 
pos/cv002_15918.txt when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . 


pos/cv211_9953.txt

pos/cv211_9953.txt with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens begins 57 years after alien ended . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but " the company " is doubtful . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca " newt " jorden ( carrie henn ) . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt horner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt not only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt in fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt the production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt then , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt surprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt weaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt lance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt however , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's " mad about you " ) . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt a very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt technically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . 
pos/cv211_9953.txt aside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while .

pos/cv394_5137.txt defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer-director albert brooks , who also stars in the comedy . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt after dying in a car crash , on his birthday of all days , brooks wakes up in judgement city , a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt brooks has five days to convince two judges that he's worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt during his " trial , " brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen , and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt it's impossible to resist chuckling ( and cringing ) at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt torn , in particular , is in vintage comic form , and he walks away with the picture . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt the movie also features meryl streep , appealing as the love-interest , and shirley maclaine , who pops up in a hilarious cameo . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt while the film is uneven , many of its gags are price less . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt take , for example , the food in judgement city : it's always the most delicious you've ever tasted . . . 
pos/cv394_5137.txt and it's also calorie-free--so chow down ! 


pos/cv648_15792.txt

pos/cv648_15792.txt jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt no problem so far . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the special effects are among the best for the star trek series . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt the action is plentiful and well done . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt this is a very good-looking movie . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt if you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . 
pos/cv648_15792.txt star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .
