neg/cv965_26688.txt a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
neg/cv965_26688.txt certain things in our lives are inevitable . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt we expect these events . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt it's part of the human condition . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt politicians exaggerate their own importance . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt even if the original story doesn't merit one . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt even if the first film is complete in itself . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt even if success is a fluke . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt  " the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the concept was brilliant . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the film itself was even more convincing . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the movie _must_ be authentic . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the first film caught lightning in a bottle . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt you have to give this effort some credit . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt instead " book of shadows " acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt unfortunately it doesn't work either . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt even weirder stuff happens . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt it's a bad plan . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the cast shows some early promise . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt a couple is doing research on a " blair witch " book . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it's ruined by poor execution . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt they're trapped in an old big weird house . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt they stupidly separate into various rooms . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt ever see this movie ? 
neg/cv965_26688.txt seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt for a storyline filled with surprises , it's oddly predicable . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt  " the blair witch project " was a rare triumph of style over substance . 
neg/cv965_26688.txt  " the book of shadows " is a triumph of tedium over promise . 


neg/cv576_15688.txt

neg/cv576_15688.txt so much for sweet returns . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's " scream , " and followed by " scream 2 , " " urban legend , " and the original , " i know what you did last summer , " a film like , " i still know what you did last summer , " was bound to be made sooner or late . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt when julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , " i still know what you did last summer , " is made . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to " ikwydls , " which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a " friday the 13th " movie . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , " i still know . . . " 
neg/cv576_15688.txt has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt also of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn't even have fun at that , like i did in the " scream " movies and , " urban legend . " 
neg/cv576_15688.txt it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt maybe the people who made , " i still know what you did last summer , " should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . 
neg/cv576_15688.txt the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead . 


neg/cv371_8197.txt

neg/cv371_8197.txt first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt an orginal plot that grows old real fast . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt men in black has defied the odds . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt tommy lee jones and will smith play two " government " agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt the ridiculous plot begins when an alien " bug " , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on " orion's belt . " 
neg/cv371_8197.txt anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn't like this film . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt i love original plots . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt this one had an original one . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? 
neg/cv371_8197.txt a sentimental moment in an alien movie ? 
neg/cv371_8197.txt nice try , but i don't think so . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt it doesn't work here . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . 
neg/cv371_8197.txt nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick . 


neg/cv552_0150.txt

neg/cv552_0150.txt this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i * did * go into this one with high expectations . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt boy , was i wrong ! 
neg/cv552_0150.txt another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the story , you ask ? 
neg/cv552_0150.txt well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt she starts having some wild hallucinations . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt so , she helps him kill three businessmen . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt guess they couldn't get the original actor back . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt who knows . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the " ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . " 
neg/cv552_0150.txt somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt this guy is * so * bad ( " how bad * is * he ? " ) , 
neg/cv552_0150.txt  * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the demons are not , however , the good guys . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt the dumb bimbo's the good guy . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt this is basically a " bad jinn " story . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt it is an * awful * movie . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt continuity ? 
neg/cv552_0150.txt who cares . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt acting ? 
neg/cv552_0150.txt  * terrible * . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt script ? 
neg/cv552_0150.txt horrible . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt sounds canned . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt unrealistic . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i do think the * rat * acting was quite good . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i have never seen rats look afraid . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt they should get nominated for an award . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt really good acting there , the best in the movie . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt  " the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . " 
neg/cv552_0150.txt a " " rating would be far too generous . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt a " 1/10 " rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt had to have something to do . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt dumb , dumb , dumb movie . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself . 
neg/cv552_0150.txt lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute " horror , " in my opinion . 


neg/cv754_7709.txt

neg/cv754_7709.txt capsule : godawful " comedy " that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt get some perspective . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt one is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt instead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt myers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit " nineties " ) agent are a waste of time . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . 
neg/cv754_7709.txt the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing .

neg/cv637_13682.txt i'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool , humming " i will always love you " and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt it isn't necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in " kevin ! " 
neg/cv637_13682.txt for at least a few more years . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt begin by scribbling " the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long " somewhere you'll always see it , perhaps on the fridge door , or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood : prince of thieves , where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman , but christian slater ( ! ) , several dozen tall trees , bows , arrows , and a canoe , too . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt after dances with wolves and jfk , you decided the world needed more three hour movies , expensive three hour movies , so you starred in and produced wyatt earp ; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend , and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend ! 
neg/cv637_13682.txt  ( she was played by joanna going in your movie-you know , the character known best in wyatt earp as " jew whore " . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking ? ) 
neg/cv637_13682.txt now , you're suffering the demise of yet another of your epics , the postman , a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworld's and tin cup's mildly lucrative box office takes . 
neg/cv637_13682.txt the postman is not the worst movie ever made-people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along .

neg/cv612_5396.txt joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt this opening sequence is very boring and slow . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt it shows joe walking to his office . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt a sequence like this should take 2 minutes . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt here , it takes over 5 . . . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt it is obvious that joe hates his job . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! ! 
neg/cv612_5396.txt joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt his doctor informs him that he has a " brain cloud . " 
neg/cv612_5396.txt this means that in a few months , he will die . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt so what does joe do ? 
neg/cv612_5396.txt quit his job , of course ! ! 
neg/cv612_5396.txt when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the " brain cloud " anyway , so joe agrees . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this " great adventure " . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt she is also , surprise , meg ryan . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt except she looks more hippyish . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt and that the " brain cloud " thing was made up ! ! 
neg/cv612_5396.txt they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! ! 
neg/cv612_5396.txt one night there is a storm . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt by pure luck , they get to the island . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! ! 
neg/cv612_5396.txt stupid or what ? 
neg/cv612_5396.txt  ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt when joe decides to , she goes in with him because " she loves him " . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt now this is where the movie should end . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt but , unfortunately , the " cheesy ending " bug comes in . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt i give this movie a . 
neg/cv612_5396.txt see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . .

neg/cv240_15948.txt georges polti once wrote a paper called " the thirty-six dramatic situations , " in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , " there's nothing new under the sun . " 
neg/cv240_15948.txt the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . " 
neg/cv240_15948.txt parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson's creek . " 
neg/cv240_15948.txt needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . 
neg/cv240_15948.txt in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . 


neg/cv796_17243.txt

neg/cv796_17243.txt wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you 
neg/cv796_17243.txt are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt this is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the 
neg/cv796_17243.txt main quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt this is done without her knowledge . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt of course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt alan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . 
neg/cv796_17243.txt and , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place .
