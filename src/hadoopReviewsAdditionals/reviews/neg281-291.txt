neg/cv396_19127.txt adam sandler isn't known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he's still a really funny guy . 
neg/cv396_19127.txt most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . 
neg/cv396_19127.txt big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler's comic performance , and it's a miserable failure . 
neg/cv396_19127.txt sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . 
neg/cv396_19127.txt as one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say " good-bye " to one another ; in addition , there's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . 
neg/cv396_19127.txt there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny .

neg/cv472_29140.txt it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt there are forced messages here and there : " go forward ; always go forward , " lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? 
neg/cv472_29140.txt contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt and then there's the music . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) . 
neg/cv472_29140.txt potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn't given towards ( almost ) everything else .

neg/cv602_8830.txt now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that's trapped inside by all the notes and chords .

neg/cv602_8830.txt sounds pretty good , doesn't it . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt well the story gets better , as eva goes on the " rainbow tour " across europe , trying to win respect . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt eva duarte was a wonderful lady . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood .

neg/cv602_8830.txt they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt as the " spiritual leader of argentina , " madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt now you may be saying , " what kind of critic is he ? , " 
neg/cv602_8830.txt and you're right . 
neg/cv602_8830.txt as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance .

neg/cv050_12128.txt my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt  ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " ) 
neg/cv050_12128.txt languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host .

neg/cv050_12128.txt perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . 
neg/cv050_12128.txt this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .

neg/cv050_12128.txt to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .

neg/cv048_18380.txt he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community .

neg/cv048_18380.txt but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . 
neg/cv048_18380.txt also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .

neg/cv369_14245.txt

neg/cv369_14245.txt renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt  . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting " skills " of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : " i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! " 
neg/cv369_14245.txt and " entrepreneurship , babycakes ! " 
neg/cv369_14245.txt standing out among my favorites . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt before it's too late . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . 
neg/cv369_14245.txt that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . 


neg/cv907_3193.txt

neg/cv907_3193.txt all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . 
neg/cv907_3193.txt on screen , it's still paper thin .

neg/cv116_28734.txt of course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance's bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , " jerry maguire " ) , a tad tricky .

neg/cv116_28734.txt initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals . 
neg/cv116_28734.txt production values are shoddy . 
neg/cv116_28734.txt most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate . 
neg/cv116_28734.txt this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen . 
neg/cv116_28734.txt rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington's plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( 'bullet in the head ? 
neg/cv116_28734.txt you got a bed ! ' ) , but he's uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast .

neg/cv116_28734.txt another " best in show " alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington's cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv's " ally mcbeal , " " sweet november " ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband's lawyer . 
neg/cv116_28734.txt mark addy ( " the full monty " ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington's fake english butler .
