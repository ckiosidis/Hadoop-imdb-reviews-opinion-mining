neg/cv590_20712.txt if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? 
neg/cv590_20712.txt the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name " bunny . " 
neg/cv590_20712.txt not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt i haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt then there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt not to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt and so on . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt the film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt willis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt unlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt as such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson's _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . 
neg/cv590_20712.txt with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled " unfilmable " inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? 
neg/cv590_20712.txt likely not . 


neg/cv572_20053.txt

neg/cv572_20053.txt 8mm is not going to enlighten your day . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt or so it seems . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt the devil changes you . ' 
neg/cv572_20053.txt these turn out to be very wise words . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt 8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt this is where everything goes awry . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt cage is the film's sole flame of energy . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? 
neg/cv572_20053.txt the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . 
neg/cv572_20053.txt this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . 


neg/cv942_18509.txt

neg/cv942_18509.txt at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt then , everything ends happily . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? 
neg/cv942_18509.txt if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? 
neg/cv942_18509.txt and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? 
neg/cv942_18509.txt these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to " wait " , and then he just rides off ! 
neg/cv942_18509.txt in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt it just completely fails altogether miserably . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt leonard maltin rightfully called it " second rate in scripting , and acting " and at-a-glance film reviews called it " a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore " . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! 
neg/cv942_18509.txt will be forgotten about . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . 
neg/cv942_18509.txt in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . 


neg/cv098_17021.txt

neg/cv098_17021.txt  " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt sound confusing ? 
neg/cv098_17021.txt it is . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt in some respects , it works . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt well , i didn't , at least . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt  " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much . 
neg/cv098_17021.txt the stars deserved better , and so did the audience . 


neg/cv956_12547.txt

neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the " who cares about plot " summer movie . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt a loose remake of the 1954 " classic " japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt the script isn't just " dumbed down , " it's lobotomized . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt stargate was a financial success . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt independence day was a runaway hit . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt  ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
neg/cv956_12547.txt worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of " adrenaline moments " capable of getting the audience involved in the action . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt in nick's words , godzilla is " a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . " 
neg/cv956_12547.txt as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt he could climb the empire state building . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : " ebert , " the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and " gene " ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt ebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , " thumbs up for new york . " 
neg/cv956_12547.txt the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt and , although the " characters " don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt it may also be word-of-mouth-proof . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . 
neg/cv956_12547.txt it's probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had .

neg/cv165_2389.txt what are we going to do with jim carrey ? 
neg/cv165_2389.txt viewers of television's " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt he even does his captain kirk impersonation . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt again . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt  ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . ) 
neg/cv165_2389.txt export it to france and you may have a hit . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt as it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt the profanity count , alone , is too high . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt the film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt sure , carrey has his moments . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? " 
neg/cv165_2389.txt ace ventura has one glaring incongruity . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag . 
neg/cv165_2389.txt and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones . 


neg/cv385_29621.txt

neg/cv385_29621.txt surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless's brittany murphy , don't say a word looked full of promise . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt hell , when i hear that " i'll never tell " whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt alas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt douglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt after a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean's koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt but with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth's head in order to get the goods inside . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt the catch - nathan only has until five o'clock to solve the puzzle ! 
neg/cv385_29621.txt whoa , the suspense is almost too much . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt don't say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt and the only real " crazy " to be found in the film is director gary fleder's ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt oliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt additionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan's every move is downright unbelievable . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt how do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? 
neg/cv385_29621.txt despite its flaws , don't say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt americans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . 
neg/cv385_29621.txt someone get me my lithium ! 


neg/cv100_12406.txt

neg/cv100_12406.txt warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt but it doesn't really make much of a difference . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
neg/cv100_12406.txt a few months later , volcano was released . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! 
neg/cv100_12406.txt by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . " 
neg/cv100_12406.txt her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt of course , leder isn't all to blame for it . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt chock full of cheesy one liners ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " ) 
neg/cv100_12406.txt and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt give me a break , will ya ? 
neg/cv100_12406.txt and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt one moment has an astronaut flying off into space . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn't work for me . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! 
neg/cv100_12406.txt you are too talented for this stuff ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's " star trek : the next generation . " 
neg/cv100_12406.txt seeing her was one of the highlights of the film . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt well , it's not . 
neg/cv100_12406.txt when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . 


neg/cv618_9469.txt

neg/cv618_9469.txt gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? 
neg/cv618_9469.txt first of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt last of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt i mean , the guy can't be that untalented , can he ? 
neg/cv618_9469.txt the answer to that question is three letters long . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent , it's hard to describe the plot . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt he works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt halfway through the film , i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt then as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt it's sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face " i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do " attitude . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt the performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn't saying much . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt at least we don't have to suffer jonathan " i am the most hideous man in america " schaech . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt we are , however treated to another round of james " i'm more wooden than keanu " duval . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film , and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki's wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt of the tv star cameos , john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation , it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt maybe greg arraki doesn't want you to like his characters . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt maybe he just wanted to piss me off . 
neg/cv618_9469.txt if so , he was successful . 


neg/cv582_6678.txt

neg/cv582_6678.txt the year is barely a week old , and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997--the relic , a would-be chiller that's more successful at making the audience laugh than scream . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean-claude van damme vehicles ) , a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt how did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ? 
neg/cv582_6678.txt the " scientific " explanation cooked up by the four--yes , four--credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes " suspension of disbelief " to new heights , even by monster movie standards . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt but as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it isn't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt give it up , penelope--it's a _monster_movie_ . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt on the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it's hard to imagine it being played any more effectively . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt it's quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt for example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt ok , we all know what's coming , but as if we didn't need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt and later , miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt does she make a beeline for the front door ? 
neg/cv582_6678.txt of course not--she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt with all the cliches , it is only fitting the film's climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball . 
neg/cv582_6678.txt if the relic is truly " the next evolution in terror " as the poster states , then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we thought .
