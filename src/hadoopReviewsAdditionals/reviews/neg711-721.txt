neg/cv078_16506.txt  " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's " leviathan , " 1989's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt  " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . 
neg/cv078_16506.txt it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? 
neg/cv078_16506.txt as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .

neg/cv204_8930.txt certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt watching glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) " not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . " 
neg/cv204_8930.txt the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , " yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . " 
neg/cv204_8930.txt finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , " people . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt  .

neg/cv204_8930.txt while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt  " pull the string ! 
neg/cv204_8930.txt pull the string ! " 
neg/cv204_8930.txt announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , " beware . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt  .

neg/cv204_8930.txt a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister " green dragon " ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ? 
neg/cv204_8930.txt for sheer cinematic disaster . 
neg/cv204_8930.txt i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .

neg/cv286_26156.txt here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy " bait " starring jamie foxx and david morse . 
neg/cv286_26156.txt this is a review i don't even want to write because i'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it's-beyond-ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff .

neg/cv286_26156.txt it's genuinely unfunny ( i , and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours ) , unoriginal and unthrilling . 
neg/cv286_26156.txt it's not so bad to the point where it's fun to watch because of its badness and it's no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it , it's just such a cliche in and of itself , that , uhh . . .

neg/cv524_24885.txt

neg/cv524_24885.txt  * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? 
neg/cv524_24885.txt  * * * 
neg/cv524_24885.txt cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes 
neg/cv524_24885.txt  " the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . " 
neg/cv524_24885.txt --- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt mr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt in actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special " treatment " on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt  ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
neg/cv524_24885.txt april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the " circuitry " and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about " gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews " . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 
neg/cv524_24885.txt i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt despite the disturbing visuals , " mom and apple pie " stuck with me for the rest of the day . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt speaking of disturbing visuals , " wedding bells ain't ringing " could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt  " i'm a lesbian " ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt one particular musical number , " lesbian rock " , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( " lesbian rock " included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt once the " isle of lesbos reprise " was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? 
neg/cv524_24885.txt isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt wait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . . 
neg/cv524_24885.txt oh , never mind .

neg/cv108_17064.txt

neg/cv108_17064.txt  " practical magic , " is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of " light-hearted whimsy , " and you have a pretty good idea how messy " practical magic " is . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt it is not charming or entertaining in any way . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt whatever . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the " batman " series with " batman forever " and " batman and robin . " 
neg/cv108_17064.txt  " practical magic " is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , " addicted to love , " with meg ryan and matthew broderick . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since " practical magic " is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . 
neg/cv108_17064.txt i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself .

neg/cv513_7236.txt capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt gibson's script only adds insult to injury . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt i say " awesomely " because it's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an " information courier " who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt he is given " one last job " ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it's only followed up on in a token fashion . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there's no room in this movie for any of that . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt  ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt but that's another essay . ) 
neg/cv513_7236.txt anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt why newark ? 
neg/cv513_7236.txt maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that's why . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn't kill him . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt everything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt snore . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un-technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt a hacker of johnny's caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that's not cinematic . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt whatever . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt what went wrong with this movie ? 
neg/cv513_7236.txt gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn't work in a movie . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn't advance , it convulses . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt from the script on out , it was probably all downhill . 
neg/cv513_7236.txt renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there's no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?

neg/cv001_19502.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
neg/cv001_19502.txt damn that y2k bug . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt little do they know the power within . . . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . 
neg/cv001_19502.txt otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . 


neg/cv249_12674.txt

neg/cv249_12674.txt synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt what was she thinking ? 
neg/cv249_12674.txt never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt 86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? 
neg/cv249_12674.txt that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's " character development . " 
neg/cv249_12674.txt someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt suspense at its very derivative ! 
neg/cv249_12674.txt as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . 
neg/cv249_12674.txt allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker . 


neg/cv700_23163.txt

neg/cv700_23163.txt  " the beach " is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of " blue lagoon " . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of " lord of the flies " where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt the main character of " the beach " is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt there are several ideas that are introduced in " the beach " and each one could merit its own feature-length film . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . 
neg/cv700_23163.txt consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .
