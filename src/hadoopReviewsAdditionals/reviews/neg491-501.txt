neg/cv509_17354.txt synopsis : nice girl susanne has sex with her boyfriend daniel in his car , visits daniel's rich family during thanksgiving at their mansion in the middle of nowhere , and has sex with daniel again in the basement . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious " surprise endings . " 
neg/cv509_17354.txt comments : thanksgiving . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt for most , it's a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good , home-cooked meal . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt for the makers of body count , however , thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders , violence , profanity , family dysfunction , and sex . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt boy , do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt alyssa milano , the former child star of who's the boss ? , matures to made-for-video sludge like this movie . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt someone somewhere thought it'd be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice-t , who has since guest-starred in the made-for-the-sci-fi-channel series welcome to paradox . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt this isn't exactly a winning combination . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me , what else may be said for this turkey ? 
neg/cv509_17354.txt well , it teaches us that beautiful , attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic , stuck-up rich white people waited on by black servants . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt it shows us that old guys , try not to laugh , sit around and talk about " the appeal of postmodernism " during their free time . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt and , it proves that you can have sex in your parents' basement when they have a dozen or so guests over , and no one will notice . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt before i go any further , if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked , forget it . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don't see any of milano's attributes . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt they do , however , inexplicably throw in a scene where ice-t whistles " jingle bells " after killing people , for whatever that's worth . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt this film was originally titled below utopia . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt perhaps they should have renamed it hell . 
neg/cv509_17354.txt avoid this clunker .

neg/cv611_2253.txt it's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt and unfortunately with man's best friend , we'll be waiting a while longer . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a " good " story provokes her to snoop inside of emax , a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max , a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake , camouflage like a chameleon , climb trees like a leopard , and attack with the strength of tiger . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt max takes a liking to sheedy , and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax , owned by henrikson . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt well , it doesn't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman , etc . . . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen , tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director ( i apologize for a lack of credits . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt i suppose i was eager to leave the theater , and in my rush , forgot to take note of the director , writer , producer , etc . . . ) . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script , giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt the movie depends upon it's ability to impress the audience with animal special effects , but all it presents is a dog that can growl , open door handles with his paw , sit , roll over , play dead , and sick . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt the rest of the special effects were so poor , i found them offensive . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt the film attains sub-mediocrity , an unambitious film at best . 
neg/cv611_2253.txt horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite . 


neg/cv787_15277.txt

neg/cv787_15277.txt my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? 
neg/cv787_15277.txt then there's " caligula . " 
neg/cv787_15277.txt this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show " historical accuracy ; " c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , " caligula " comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since " plan 9 from outer space " because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes ) . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with " caligula , " and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt  " caligula " allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or 
neg/cv787_15277.txt so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage " what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , " depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in " a clockwork orange " did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in " lawrence of arabia " ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ? 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and that they killed people so disgustingly ? 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's " adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? " ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : " he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . " ) 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous " adagio of spartacus and phrygia , " ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated " x " ) . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , " i'm going to kill my agent , i'm going to kill my agent . . . " 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making " caligula " about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying " look what i can get away with ! 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and if you don't like this , then you're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! " 
neg/cv787_15277.txt uh huh . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt there's a film that came out in 1989 called " the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , " a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it's going to be offensive to many . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . 
neg/cv787_15277.txt and it's everything " caligula " might have been but , alas , wasn't . 


neg/cv496_11185.txt

neg/cv496_11185.txt an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt it's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt his luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt it's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt as the movie grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto . 
neg/cv496_11185.txt if you're in the mood for this type of movie , you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

neg/cv814_20316.txt  " the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) , man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt now , " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt the story , if that's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and is banished from his home land . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt he's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt that's basically the entire plot . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt we don't get to know any of the characters and so we don't care who lives and who dies . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action-adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt it was directed by john mctiernan who's , " the thomas crown affair " is also playing in theaters currently . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt and it's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , " the 13th warrior " was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences . 
neg/cv814_20316.txt it belongs back on the shelf . 


neg/cv180_17823.txt

neg/cv180_17823.txt  " goodbye , lover " sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt it's a mess . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is " at least she died healthy . " 
neg/cv180_17823.txt and that's one of her wittier asides . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt degeneres' sgt . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt it's best described this way : 
neg/cv180_17823.txt sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a " creative yet unfocused " ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt at least the former " ellen " star is going for something a little different . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : " lost highway , " " true romance " ) while quoting embarrassing lines like " i'm not wearing any underwear . " 
neg/cv180_17823.txt i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt so what was the point of the wig and the car ? 
neg/cv180_17823.txt  " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch's " wild at heart , " but if so joff ? must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt it's hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . " 
neg/cv180_17823.txt it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . 
neg/cv180_17823.txt it should have stayed there .

neg/cv605_12730.txt hunter s . thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as " gonzo " . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt soon after the book was written , hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . ) 
neg/cv605_12730.txt although the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson's own assessment of the novel as " unfilmable . " 
neg/cv605_12730.txt the main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt it was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons , relatively sober , at his home . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt hunter s . thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt unfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp's ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt and the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson's ) and his riding companion , dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt the film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt from there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including one of the few good scenes in which depp , high on acid , watches all the people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt while the movie has its moments ( few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts , especially towards the end . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt despite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars never get off the ground . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt the set decoration and costumes are great , and probably deserve an oscar nomination . 
neg/cv605_12730.txt however , as we all know , it's not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good . 


neg/cv898_1576.txt

neg/cv898_1576.txt okay , okay . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt howewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt boy , was i wrong ! 
neg/cv898_1576.txt in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? 
neg/cv898_1576.txt too many . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt simply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt you'll be looking at it for most of the movie . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt my . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt rent die hard . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt read a book . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt stare at the sky . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . 
neg/cv898_1576.txt they probably like wrestling too : - ) . 


neg/cv424_9268.txt

neg/cv424_9268.txt it's time to take cover . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt harry survived , but his wife did not . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt this film contains a number of cliches . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the amorous couple is one . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , " cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . " 
neg/cv424_9268.txt even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt  " is that your recipe for frog soup ? " 
neg/cv424_9268.txt asks one of the team members . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt  " it's my recipe for disaster , " responds harry . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , " acid eats metal . " 
neg/cv424_9268.txt thanks for the tip . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , " u . s . geological survey . " 
neg/cv424_9268.txt i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ? 
neg/cv424_9268.txt were they even attracted to each other ? " 
neg/cv424_9268.txt if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt who does he think he is ? 
neg/cv424_9268.txt james bond ? 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt there are several " warning signs " prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt a tremor occurs . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt does he plunge headlong to his death ? 
neg/cv424_9268.txt is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? 
neg/cv424_9268.txt no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt it wasn't . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt there are a couple of good things about this movie . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the first is the scenery . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt the second is the special effects . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt they are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . 
neg/cv424_9268.txt but when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script .
