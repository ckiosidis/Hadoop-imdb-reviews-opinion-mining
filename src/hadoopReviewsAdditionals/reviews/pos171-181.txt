pos/cv329_29370.txt synopsis : retiring detective jerry black ( nicholson ) becomes involved in the case of a murdered girl , and promises her parents that he will find the killer . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt he purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer takes , and there befriends lori ( wright penn ) and her young daughter . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt as jerry and lori fall in love , can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge ? 
pos/cv329_29370.txt review : at first , " the pledge " appears to be just another standard , if well-executed , crime drama . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt it is anything but ; in its final hour , it turns the corner and becomes a riveting , terrifying study of its lead character , jerry black . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre , but they are just window dressing . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt his interest here , unequivocally , is jerry , a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt at first , we see this only in small hints ; some of his habits change , for instance , and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt but then , when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori , the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt nicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast , too . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt penn's direction is astounding , each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water , perhaps , or of sanity . 
pos/cv329_29370.txt it all builds up to a shattering , devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up .

pos/cv647_13691.txt if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their " piece of the action " , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those " better judgement " is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band " wang chung " , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . 
pos/cv647_13691.txt in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it .

pos/cv654_18246.txt the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt now in hamunaptra , the three uncover " the book of the dead . " 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt when playing " george " in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the mummy could have gotten an " a " rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the cinematography is amazing in the mummy . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . 
pos/cv654_18246.txt the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .

pos/cv343_10368.txt  " it's not good to know too much about someone , charlie , " charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her " soul mate " as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt there's a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt john gay's script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt karen arthur's direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don't know about his nefarious activities . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the " average american family , " but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt charlie , who first welcomed her uncle's visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt she wants him to leave , and he doesn't want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt will charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt my only quibble is the director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt is hitchcock's version better ? 
pos/cv343_10368.txt of course . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt is this one worth watching as well ? 
pos/cv343_10368.txt actually , yes . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt shadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . 
pos/cv343_10368.txt it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up . 


pos/cv450_7890.txt

pos/cv450_7890.txt scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt many of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt nearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt along with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt tony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank's lover . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt of course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt this is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt no one can trust him , and basically , no one does . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt scarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt in fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word " fuck " and it's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt the thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt as odd as it sounds , it's true . 
pos/cv450_7890.txt in the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard . 


pos/cv618_8974.txt

pos/cv618_8974.txt director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt fincher's the game is no exception to this . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt fincher hasn't made a film since " seven , " his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt so it is about time he made another film . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt and what a ride it is . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the game isn't quite as powerful as " seven , " but in some ways it is better . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt unfortunately , unlike " the usual suspects , " we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the game is told completely from its main character's point of view . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt  " it will make your life fun again , " his brother promises . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt  " each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , " explains feingold . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt with " seven , " fincher had almost every single shot mean something . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt compared to " seven , " though , the game is light and comical . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt perhaps that is the reason i docked the film . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt can he believe the waitress he bumped into ? 
pos/cv618_8974.txt what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? 
pos/cv618_8974.txt douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his " falling down " persona ) . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt deborah kara unger ( from " crash " ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from " shine " ) as the book editor . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt what is essential for this film to work is the writing . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . 
pos/cv618_8974.txt and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .

pos/cv289_6463.txt in this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt . cmdr .

pos/cv289_6463.txt worf ( michael dorn ) , dr . beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige ) . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt the borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard ) . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d . moore . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt the other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt in the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt the story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt frakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt st : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen ) . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt braga and moore's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e . g . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt the ongoing saga of data's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm . 
pos/cv289_6463.txt based on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i'd say the studio has nothing to worry about ( at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek : deep space nine takes over . . . ) .

pos/cv080_13465.txt roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? 
pos/cv080_13465.txt let's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! 
pos/cv080_13465.txt the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt gunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .

pos/cv080_13465.txt there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt but even too many explosions can get boring .

pos/cv080_13465.txt luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . 
pos/cv080_13465.txt meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .

pos/cv080_13465.txt russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .

pos/cv150_12916.txt

pos/cv150_12916.txt in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt apparently , it was just lying dormant . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer " popcorn " movie season's lack of substance . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . 
pos/cv150_12916.txt pass the popcorn .
