pos/cv017_22464.txt the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the film only gets better from this point . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt they walk in unison and they only look forward . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt one that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt  " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt however , as the film develops so does ness . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt malone acts as a mentor to ness . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt also very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . 
pos/cv017_22464.txt some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . 


pos/cv274_25253.txt

pos/cv274_25253.txt i know that " funnest " isn't a word . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt  " fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt what sort of pies ? 
pos/cv274_25253.txt chicken pies , of course . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt  " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
pos/cv274_25253.txt park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . " 
pos/cv274_25253.txt there's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt why ? 
pos/cv274_25253.txt because once you got past the thought that " they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt conversely , " chicken run " doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt if you've never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt the animation is first-rate . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . 
pos/cv274_25253.txt funnest damn movie i've seen all year . 


pos/cv588_13008.txt

pos/cv588_13008.txt one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt the main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt dr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt the performances are all very commendable . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt both jacques and windsor play their parts well . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . 
pos/cv588_13008.txt a must-see carry on movie . 


pos/cv700_21947.txt

pos/cv700_21947.txt let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt for the most part , the action sequences worked very well . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt the world is not enough is no exception . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt 007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt why this point is included is beyond me . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt after all , it isn't shakespeare . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt how about the cast ? 
pos/cv700_21947.txt brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt then there are the bond girls . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt then we have denise richards . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt he says future appearances are up to a higher power . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt so how does it stack up ? 
pos/cv700_21947.txt despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt this is easily the best of the brosnan films . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . 
pos/cv700_21947.txt here's looking forward to bond number 20 .

pos/cv915_8841.txt what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ? 
pos/cv915_8841.txt to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt then it hits them : they are not successful . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt what are she and michele going to do ? 
pos/cv915_8841.txt romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , " bag a couple of boyfriends , " and get jobs . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt  " i was so lucky getting mono , " she says looking at her thinnest high school picture . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt  " that was like the best diet ever . " 
pos/cv915_8841.txt the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt the film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt at sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds ) . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt romy and michele were none of the above . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt ridiculed as " the weirdoes , " they were constant targets for abuse . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt even though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt complementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt heather , who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with " twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go , " has the success and the money that they would like . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt garofalo's one-dimensional role is only a side show . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy . 
pos/cv915_8841.txt they have so much fun acting out their parts , their enjoyment spreads to the audience .

pos/cv207_29284.txt with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt but margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt  " stay away from my son " margaret warns darby reese . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel " the blank wall , " " the deep end " is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( " suture " ) . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( " caravaggio , " " edward ii , " " the last of england " ) , plays margaret hall in " the deep end " and , like charlotte rampling in this year's " under the sand , " turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . 
pos/cv207_29284.txt the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon . 


pos/cv317_24049.txt

pos/cv317_24049.txt john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
pos/cv317_24049.txt was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt she responded with her usual query , " whose in that one ? " 
pos/cv317_24049.txt this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt anyway , when i answered " john cusack " , she replied with a rather stunned " who ? " , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an " oh - him , yes he's quite good " instead i got a " no - i don't know him " . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt cu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as " the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) " . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his " top 5 break ups list " . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt but i like this guy , because of how black plays him . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt  ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt but fears and black never let that happen . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own " charm " . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those " special people " whose wheels turn a little slower ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt fears' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i'm beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i'll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . 
pos/cv317_24049.txt his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . 


pos/cv030_21593.txt

pos/cv030_21593.txt linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt it's a wild ride . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt wings of desire this ain't . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt  ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) 
pos/cv030_21593.txt his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! 
pos/cv030_21593.txt smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt  ( not one of them had watched it . ) 
pos/cv030_21593.txt every single person refused . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt  ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt my religion is movies . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . 
pos/cv030_21593.txt i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .

pos/cv235_10217.txt near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt he has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt standing upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt he has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt as a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt but times and ambitions change . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt things happen , and he's stuck . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt his guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's 
pos/cv235_10217.txt a wonderful life . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt in a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt he learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt his earthly problems are solved . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt the climatic scene is a marvel . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt frank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt they aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt nevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt here is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential . 
pos/cv235_10217.txt the result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved . 


pos/cv734_21568.txt

pos/cv734_21568.txt i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . 
pos/cv734_21568.txt but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . 
pos/cv734_21568.txt it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .
