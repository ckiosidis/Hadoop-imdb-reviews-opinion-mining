neg/cv443_22367.txt at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt now my view has completely changed . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt a person can only take so much . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt alan rickman however was not so lucky . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt when will it stop ? 
neg/cv443_22367.txt i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt is that too much to ask ? 
neg/cv443_22367.txt obviously it is . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt it's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining . 
neg/cv443_22367.txt the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .

neg/cv575_22598.txt take two old and dying men , a lifetime of regrets , a house full of sins , a thoroughly despicable man , enough lies , insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed , then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibian-based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia , the newest film from paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights ) . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt the movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt would that the stories were worth the telling . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt earl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt bedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt his much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt having married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to " seduce and destroy , " his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt meanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt not as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt the current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt on the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a " somebody . " 
neg/cv575_22598.txt his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c . reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt yes , frogs . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn't seem to faze the characters much . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt oh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower didn't seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt mr . anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of " historical " occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : " we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us . " 
neg/cv575_22598.txt this is an absolute lie . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt god is in the forgiveness business . 
neg/cv575_22598.txt in fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god's word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets .

neg/cv339_22452.txt inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt directed by william malone . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt starring geoffrey rush , famke janssen , and chris kattan . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt rated r ( contains violence , profanity , and brief nudity ) . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt synopsis : eccentric millionaire price offers $1 , 000 , 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment , an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt comments : house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt in an obvious homage , the millionaire's name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt this is a pretty bad horror film , yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining , and house on haunted hill is just such a film . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt it is , surprisingly , better than another recent haunted house remake , the haunting , a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it's a crappy horror movie . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt thus , somehow , it proves slightly more successful . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt i can't think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt it is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt price , the main character , is played by geoffrey rush , the academy-award winning actor of shine . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry , a spiral reminiscent of ben ( ghandi , schindler's list ) kingsley's ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic species . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt i don't know why , but sometimes it's entertaining to see " quality " actors in bad movies . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt more surprises ? 
neg/cv339_22452.txt rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure ( rather lamely too ) , and singer lisa loeb ( ! ) 
neg/cv339_22452.txt appears as a tv news reporter . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt the highlight of the cast , however , has to be saturday night live member chris kattan . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt kattan's comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what's exactly going on , the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt house on haunted hill , i suspect , has just about left the second-run theaters . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt it's worth catching on cable next year , if you get a chance . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt if you have a choice , pick this movie over the haunting , it's the better of two evils , you could say . 
neg/cv339_22452.txt though , more appropriately perhaps , it'd be better to say that it's the better of two turkeys . 


neg/cv272_20313.txt

neg/cv272_20313.txt i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt but where are the thrills ? 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the laughs ? 
neg/cv272_20313.txt both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt and what a shame that is . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the plot is a big problem here . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt in the morning . . . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt how convenient ! 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt the humor is completely inconsistent . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt a moment like that never arises . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . 
neg/cv272_20313.txt we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . 


neg/cv296_13146.txt

neg/cv296_13146.txt everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' 
neg/cv296_13146.txt in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt 'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's 
neg/cv296_13146.txt humans . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt that should teach us for squishing all those bugs . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt their reasonable good fun , however . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt a good opportunity , then , wasted . 
neg/cv296_13146.txt a shame .

neg/cv224_18875.txt

neg/cv224_18875.txt plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt critique : wow . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ? 
neg/cv224_18875.txt who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack . 
neg/cv224_18875.txt this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wanna be mike ovitz !

neg/cv970_19532.txt

neg/cv970_19532.txt the " disney stick-to-what-you-do-best " rule states that disney's animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids' entertainment , they will fail miserably . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? 
neg/cv970_19532.txt i'm still trying to forget ) . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children's film .

neg/cv970_19532.txt it's films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his " role " as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda's father . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt dr . brenda has been working on a " gadget project , " which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime .

neg/cv970_19532.txt now , when he says " go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] " he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown's worst nemesis . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams " hey ! 
neg/cv970_19532.txt you ran a stop sign ! "

neg/cv970_19532.txt i think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt in addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt there's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt there's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called " death slug " . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco !

neg/cv970_19532.txt they probably could have replaced " death slug " with inspector gadget . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt it's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days comes from animation . 
neg/cv970_19532.txt animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work .

neg/cv892_18788.txt okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : 
neg/cv892_18788.txt what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt whew . okay . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt even i know that you need more footage than * that * . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt can't beat that ) . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt not romantic at all , and only funny in some places . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt or the fairy godfather ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt she can * float * now too ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's " witchcraft " in the end ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt what the hell is up with that damn crab ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming " cruel intentions " ) than this sorry excuse for a character . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in " you've got mail " ( see footnotes ) . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  " simply irresistible " is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt and how could i refrain from making a pun ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  " simply irresistible " is all too easy to resist . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to " you've got mail " ( or " the shop around the corner " ) ? 
neg/cv892_18788.txt business rivals fall in love . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt female counterpart's business is in danger of being shut down . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt female as mother- like figure guiding her . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . 
neg/cv892_18788.txt  * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar's wardrobe . 


neg/cv328_10908.txt

neg/cv328_10908.txt topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - " we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related " - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt such a disappointment after such a brilliant start . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . 
neg/cv328_10908.txt it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . 


neg/cv419_14799.txt

neg/cv419_14799.txt did i do something bad ? 
neg/cv419_14799.txt i must have , because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt here's the plot . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network , one of those 24-hour home shopping channels . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the new boss ( robert loggia ) plans to can ricky's behind if he doesn't turn the previous months' flat sales numbers around , and to add to his problems , ricky also has to work with kate ( kelly preston ) , the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt kate and ricky don't get along and don't have any great ideas until they meet g ( eddie murphy ) , a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good , and it's this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network's success . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the first problem is a flaw in the plot . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt sure , g makes people feel good . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt sure , we're told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item , no matter how wealthy they might be , and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt but , hey , that's after they've bought it . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera ? 
neg/cv419_14799.txt far from trying to sell the product , g instead blathers on about how you don't even need the thing . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt you might say that people feel good about what they've bought , so they come back and by more , but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable , i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt another problem is in the humor . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt you know , if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie , i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt whoa , partner , are you in for a surprise . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt holy man is not funny . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt murphy , the one asset you'd think this movie has ( remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense ? 
neg/cv419_14799.txt - then again , maybe you don't ) is seriously reigned in . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the script gives him almost nothing to work with , and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn't be left as window dressing . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt there's only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose , and it lasts for three shouted words , which seem totally out of place as a result . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt pathetic . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt in all , there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture , and they're not even that great . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt as a side note , there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine , and james brown introducing a medic-alert device that shouts " help me ! " 
neg/cv419_14799.txt just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button , but these never cause your personal laugh-o-meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt  " well , " you ask , " surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor . " 
neg/cv419_14799.txt think again , buckwheat . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt jeff goldblum disappoints . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt kelly preston is flat ( but not like that ) . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt robert loggia , in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast , can't do anything with it . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the script is part of the problem , but these actors don't even look like they believe in the move they're making . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt they look a lot like they're bored . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt just like the audience . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy , and the acting is like the siberian steppes ? 
neg/cv419_14799.txt a film that drags more than a dropped anchor . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt but wait ! 
neg/cv419_14799.txt as if these problems don't make the film slow enough , the screenplay's pacing makes the movie even slower ! 
neg/cv419_14799.txt it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie's premise , then more time as the film wades through a tortuous ( and seemingly mandatory ) romance between ricky and kate , and a sub-plot involving a conniving pr man ( eric mccormack ) who wants to discredit g and take over ricky's job as producer . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt when the pr guy's plan is foiled , the film is climaxes , we're treated to that little epilogue , and then we can all go home , right ? 
neg/cv419_14799.txt wrong . 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the movie goes on for another half hour ! 
neg/cv419_14799.txt continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man ! 
neg/cv419_14799.txt the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming " holy ! @#% that movie was awful ! " 
neg/cv419_14799.txt this one is for the truly pious .
