neg/cv744_10091.txt talk about beating a dead horse ! 
neg/cv744_10091.txt when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the " home alone " name as well . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt these are far worse . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ? 
neg/cv744_10091.txt there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? 
neg/cv744_10091.txt the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt but , because this is a " family film , " no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt it's an exercise in tediousness , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . 
neg/cv744_10091.txt maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . 


neg/cv880_29629.txt

neg/cv880_29629.txt the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt ben gets emotionally involved with alessa . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt  ( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we're fuck buddies . " ) 
neg/cv880_29629.txt but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee's inability to decide what she wants to be saying . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt this appears to be a high profile and well-paid job . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt we are supposed to care about alessa's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero . 
neg/cv880_29629.txt i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv824_9335.txt

neg/cv824_9335.txt toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt this carl " apollo creed " weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs . evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , " you tore his arm off ! " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt jackson replies , " he had a spare . " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt  " not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt and of course it turns out stone is mrs . dellaplane . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt faux pas , jackson . . . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation . " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt he responds , " you're getting one , " and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs . . . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt or at least the prince . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt jackson's response is , " i think i felt that way once . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt they called it love . " 
neg/cv824_9335.txt you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . 
neg/cv824_9335.txt serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century ! 


neg/cv768_12709.txt

neg/cv768_12709.txt this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in " beverly hills " ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ? 
neg/cv768_12709.txt there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt and guess what ? 
neg/cv768_12709.txt that's about as complex as it gets . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt he's my fifth nom for a razzie . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt naturally , they win , or sort of half-win . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? 
neg/cv768_12709.txt isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ? 
neg/cv768_12709.txt the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . 
neg/cv768_12709.txt well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . 


neg/cv601_24759.txt

neg/cv601_24759.txt so i went and saw this film right , it was called " battlefield : earth " , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than " mr . magoo " , " blue in the face " , or " jaws : the revenge " . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt roger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as " alien " and " star wars " , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it's quite depressing . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i've heard . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt here's the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i 
neg/cv601_24759.txt wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those " man-animals " to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's " the green mile " ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! 
neg/cv601_24759.txt one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt of course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) 
neg/cv601_24759.txt forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it's terrible . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt everything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt throughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn't . 
neg/cv601_24759.txt my advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more . 


neg/cv437_24070.txt

neg/cv437_24070.txt  * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * 
neg/cv437_24070.txt cast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes 
neg/cv437_24070.txt the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt before i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt dr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt clich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper " u'tinni " to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the " he would have wanted you to have this " moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt at other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be " smarter " than i am ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt during the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt a brief history lesson about " where we came from " is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with " the rest of our people " ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that " this is a chance to step foot where no one else has " ) . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt >from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt i'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt let's just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn't hurt by the negativity this film is generating . 
neg/cv437_24070.txt i'd venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time .

neg/cv194_12855.txt

neg/cv194_12855.txt this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom " doc " scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : " stand and deliver ! " 
neg/cv194_12855.txt owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! 
neg/cv194_12855.txt there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise' and sporting a fake french accent . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! 
neg/cv194_12855.txt a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . 
neg/cv194_12855.txt none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here .

neg/cv330_29675.txt august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to see slaughtered against family-oriented thanksgiving films .

neg/cv330_29675.txt parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt don't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a " ment " away from being a fetish film , isn't that entertaining . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt in fact , you'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc . , harry potter ) come out next month . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy , then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it ) . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz , home alone 3 ) as a pint-sized superhero , delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross , foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man ( jamie kennedy , jay and silent bob strike back ) and landing the neighborhood honey ( brooke anne smith ) , who , by the way , is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt the scenario is , of course , a dream . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude , no luck with the ladies and only two friends , both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts ( and who were both in snow day ) - the perpetually robed robe ( josh peck ) and a clarinet-playing cutie named megan ( summer catch's zena grey ) , who harbors secret feelings for max . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school . 
neg/cv330_29675.txt he has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of polar-opposite bullies ( noel fisher and orlando brown ) , and an illiterate principal ( larry miller , the princess diaries ) who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program .

neg/cv330_29675.txt director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless

neg/cv511_10360.txt

neg/cv511_10360.txt 14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt they've been cremated . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the premise is basically the same . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt of course a " vacation " movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt it's really just a skit movie . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation comes off like the first . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt in these cases , a " plot " , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt such is the case with this movie's mini-plots . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt chase plays clark griswold really well . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt he made the character and he is the character . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt as for the two new griswold kids , the word " blah " comes to mind . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the " vacation " series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt they're so generic , you'll expect the credits to read " girl #1 as audrey griswold " . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt yes , it's true that vegas vacation isn't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon's heading on the title ? 
neg/cv511_10360.txt i couldn't find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn't want to be associated with such a lame film . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt that's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn't . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt the first three films in the " vacation " series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80's including mr . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller's day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt wowzers ! 
neg/cv511_10360.txt what a r ? sum ? ! 
neg/cv511_10360.txt looking at the names , you'd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980's . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt well that's not all . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt this guy also brought us 90's hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation , however , didn't have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt this time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt if this sounds like a wild idea , it's not . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it's quite out of place . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt stephen kessler's jejune direction doesn't help things either . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt he only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt each consecutive " vacation " movie has suffered a drop in directing power . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt we started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt not too bad . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt then we had national lampoon's european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who's talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt lastly we had national lampoon's christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt kessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt if you loved the " vacation " movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn't anything here worth seeing . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt if you loved them , don't ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . 
neg/cv511_10360.txt if you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ? 


neg/cv090_0049.txt

neg/cv090_0049.txt various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
neg/cv090_0049.txt it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 
neg/cv090_0049.txt a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham's story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
neg/cv090_0049.txt after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 
neg/cv090_0049.txt this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 
neg/cv090_0049.txt add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt some gore . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt don't bring children to this one . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt blech . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt  . no fun whatsoever . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled 
neg/cv090_0049.txt this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt c -- $2 . 50 . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements 
neg/cv090_0049.txt after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 
neg/cv090_0049.txt 1 ) be wary of french comedies . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt these people like jerry lewis . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt 2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt 3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt 4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! 
neg/cv090_0049.txt australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt lots and lots of horses . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . 
neg/cv090_0049.txt grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks .
