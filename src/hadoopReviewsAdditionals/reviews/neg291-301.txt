neg/cv555_25047.txt what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ? 
neg/cv555_25047.txt you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma ) . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ? 
neg/cv555_25047.txt you get an audience in a coma . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt " big momma " ( ella mitchell ) . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt however , big momma is called away on an emergency . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt and let the comedy begin ! 
neg/cv555_25047.txt big momma's house is the definition of a " gimmick " movie if there ever was one . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt the plot can basically be summed up as " martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman " . . . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt and even that description is too wordy . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it , and all sorts of clich ? d , " humorous " situations pointing to it . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt fat woman plays basketball ! 
neg/cv555_25047.txt fat woman takes a dump ! 
neg/cv555_25047.txt fat woman kung fu ! 
neg/cv555_25047.txt well they left one off the board . . . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt movie critic slips into coma ! 
neg/cv555_25047.txt paul giamatti ( private parts , the negotiator ) plays lawrence's partner and as much as i enjoy his work , even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt hell , the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work . . . 
neg/cv555_25047.txt it's just that awful . 


neg/cv809_5012.txt

neg/cv809_5012.txt die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt so much for the script . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt how about the action ? 
neg/cv809_5012.txt well , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt by contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . 
neg/cv809_5012.txt die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .

neg/cv817_3675.txt we're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo's vision of a william gibson-inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber-courier " who smuggles data via a " wet-wired " implant . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt he's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long-term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt he's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice-t , and dina meyer . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt  ( dolph lundgren's street preacher is in an acting category all its own . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt  : - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx--such as miniatures and mattes--leave a lot to be desired . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt watch out for those bad blue-screens ! 
neg/cv817_3675.txt we wouldn't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt too bad the debut director isn't very strong in this de- partment . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . 
neg/cv817_3675.txt skip it . 


neg/cv226_26692.txt

neg/cv226_26692.txt not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable " comedies " called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt ick . . . real 
neg/cv226_26692.txt sweet stuff . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a " cheese " factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt yipes . . . another 
neg/cv226_26692.txt beauty . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? 
neg/cv226_26692.txt uhhhm , you guessed it . . . not 
neg/cv226_26692.txt much . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a " sluttier " version of her character of phoebe on tv's " friends " . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt he didn't fit the part . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave " je ne sais quoi " . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented " dumb blonde " routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt give this dude his own movie ! 
neg/cv226_26692.txt he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms . . . now 
neg/cv226_26692.txt there's a base of humor . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt and there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience . 
neg/cv226_26692.txt but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i'm there ! 


neg/cv506_17521.txt

neg/cv506_17521.txt this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it . 


neg/cv668_18848.txt

neg/cv668_18848.txt there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than " the mod squad , " a self-consciously " hip " cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt well , said " squad " certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt a contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of botulism . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt they are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt when you're supposed to be asking , " what's going to happen next ? " , 
neg/cv668_18848.txt you'll instead entertain thoughts like " who are these people and why should i care ? " 
neg/cv668_18848.txt or " aren't thrillers supposed to contain thrills ? " 
neg/cv668_18848.txt not that danes , epps and ribisi don't give it a shot . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by " my so-called life , " but she's saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt ditto for ribisi's ( " saving private ryan " ) looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt but epps - poor epps . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt epps ( " higher learning " ) is so short-changed he's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive ) , it'll somehow pay off , but this " mod squad " plods anyway . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt characters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt plot hardly escapes confusing convention . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt and the one genre element you'd think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions , some fights , any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt all those quick to put down last month's inept but serviceable " my favorite martian " update need to take a step back . 
neg/cv668_18848.txt here's a small-to-big-screen translation that really should've stayed in its former incarnation , " mod " or not . 


neg/cv693_19147.txt

neg/cv693_19147.txt i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt annie is a happy woman . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt but none of them can save the film from being a bore . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue " sleepless in seattle , " whom she has never even seen . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt in essence , this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . 
neg/cv693_19147.txt if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it , you could just call me " asleep in philadelphia . "

neg/cv846_29359.txt

neg/cv846_29359.txt capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the gags are sporadically funny . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt  ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) 
neg/cv846_29359.txt  , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
neg/cv846_29359.txt a film needs a plot . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt it needs characters for empathy value . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt it needs a story and an emotional center . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt there was not enough cleverness or variety . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt penis jokes work only so many times . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt this leaves them at loose ends . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt jay has to be the comic . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt the film does not offer much to an adult audience . 
neg/cv846_29359.txt i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv181_16083.txt

neg/cv181_16083.txt as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt second , the sex is just bad . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's " dawson's creek , " is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt other stars are similarly young and unmemorable . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . 
neg/cv181_16083.txt this is certainly missable .

neg/cv709_11173.txt i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt and the kid actors are great , as well . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt but we're talking about the script from hell . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , " no , that would be far too tasteless . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt there's no way they'll do that . . . oh 
neg/cv709_11173.txt god ! " 
neg/cv709_11173.txt they did do it . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt it's there . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i found it deplorable . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt the film is filled with scenes like these . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt in fact , it's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i suppose it's important to admit that this is a funny film . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt and if you're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt i , however , can't get past these elements . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn't be learning . 
neg/cv709_11173.txt with a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .
