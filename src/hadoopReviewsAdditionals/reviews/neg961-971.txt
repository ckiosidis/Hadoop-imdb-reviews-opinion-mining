neg/cv533_9843.txt keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt they need not have wasted their time . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt keep cool just isn't very funny . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt headache , as i said . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt of course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the bookseller would be better off without her . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt there are a few things that keep cool does right . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt in one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt the nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt with every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . 
neg/cv533_9843.txt unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . 


neg/cv010_29063.txt

neg/cv010_29063.txt best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) 
neg/cv010_29063.txt he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) 
neg/cv010_29063.txt l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt the restraint is admirable . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt it's too much . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt this plot thread predictably leads to violence . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt in this regard , l . i . e . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt  ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . 
neg/cv010_29063.txt how often does real life work this way ? 
neg/cv010_29063.txt to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? 


neg/cv704_17622.txt

neg/cv704_17622.txt after 1993's " falling down , " i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt since then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( " the client " and " a time to kill " ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential , the publicity for his latest release , " 8mm , " raised new hope . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt it promised to be something unusual . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt it wasn't . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt the plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband's belongings . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher's " batman & robin " ) . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt because murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt by combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl's name and tracks her to los angeles . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt with the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader's " hardcore , " in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt both films are modeled on dante's " the inferno , " of course ; " 8mm " makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt  " hardcore " is a much more subtle and meaningful film . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt  " 8mm " had a lot of promise . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt in its better moments it's an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt one moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he's reading truman capote's " in cold blood " underneath the cover of a porn novel . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt  " in cold blood " was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , " dance with the devil and the devil don't change ; the devil changes you . " 
neg/cv704_17622.txt tom does change-i'll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn't have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn't come back . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt  ( walker's " seven " did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt cage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn't give him enough to work with . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt phoenix walks away with the movie-he's smart , charming , and funny . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt other cast members include " fargo " 's peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and " the sopranos " 's james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt in the last analysis , since " 8mm " falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . 
neg/cv704_17622.txt however , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year's " twilight , " for example- " 8mm " is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is . 


neg/cv299_17950.txt

neg/cv299_17950.txt 8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt 8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) 
neg/cv299_17950.txt here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt 8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . 
neg/cv299_17950.txt and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . 


neg/cv358_11557.txt

neg/cv358_11557.txt wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad " no nudity " clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt kevin bacon ) is familiar with . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school .

neg/cv358_11557.txt one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) .

neg/cv358_11557.txt meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt this is definitely not a character- based motion picture . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps .

neg/cv358_11557.txt and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? 
neg/cv358_11557.txt wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . 
neg/cv358_11557.txt but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .

neg/cv135_12506.txt  ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt flipper , 1996 ) . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt his role is also vastly underwritten . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt the supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? 
neg/cv135_12506.txt well , yes and no . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . 
neg/cv135_12506.txt let's hope armageddon is a bit better .

neg/cv963_7208.txt

neg/cv963_7208.txt absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt marshall ) . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the man ? 
neg/cv963_7208.txt he is the president of the united states of america . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt where does the film go wrong ? 
neg/cv963_7208.txt it cannot be the acting . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt police officers are everywhere , incognito of course . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt all three parties are unaware of each others presence . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt however , trying is simply not enough ! 
neg/cv963_7208.txt the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt everything this film is not . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? 
neg/cv963_7208.txt how could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? 
neg/cv963_7208.txt i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . 
neg/cv963_7208.txt director quentin tarantino once said : " i can make a good movie out of any bad script . " 
neg/cv963_7208.txt director clint eastwood obviously cannot . 


neg/cv850_18185.txt

neg/cv850_18185.txt 1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same " high concept " . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt in summer 1994 , that " high concept " was " mad bomber action thriller " . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt in few weeks , " thrillride of the summer " actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove's colleagues , friends and relatives . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt the film have few bright points , though . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague . 
neg/cv850_18185.txt but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor . 


neg/cv279_19452.txt

neg/cv279_19452.txt the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt now don't think i condone this just because i'm male . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt darnell doesn't think like this . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , " i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? " 
neg/cv279_19452.txt after all , it is largely darnell's fault . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt  ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) 
neg/cv279_19452.txt now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's " immature play " as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt but all of a sudden she says yes . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! 
neg/cv279_19452.txt lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt look at this movie . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt there are some bright spots , though . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . 
neg/cv279_19452.txt and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film . 


neg/cv940_18935.txt

neg/cv940_18935.txt yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable . 
neg/cv940_18935.txt since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? 
neg/cv940_18935.txt go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else .
