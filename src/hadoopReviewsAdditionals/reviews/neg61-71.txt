neg/cv627_12603.txt phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt he recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy , also referred to in the movie as werewolfism , and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt as directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt jeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft-spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt as her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt the picture is filled with stereotypes . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt there's a mysterious , loud-mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she's a lesbian . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt and the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt one can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt shopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 . 
neg/cv627_12603.txt it is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers .

neg/cv118_28837.txt roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt ben kingsley ? " 
neg/cv118_28837.txt my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the second punch comes from gal's past . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " 
neg/cv118_28837.txt however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt it is not a great plot . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt it is an old plot dressed up to look new . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt we see one side of a person's faces . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . 
neg/cv118_28837.txt i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv505_12926.txt

neg/cv505_12926.txt well , what are you going to expect ? 
neg/cv505_12926.txt it's a movie about a big snake that eats people . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt led by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt most bad characters are either annoying or stupid . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt in this movie , they're both . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt there are no standout performances here . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt absolutely ridiculous . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt eeeewwwww . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt when i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt this one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt no such luck . 
neg/cv505_12926.txt okay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . 


neg/cv199_9721.txt

neg/cv199_9721.txt come on hollywood , surprise me . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt personal , because his niece is one of the victims . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , 
neg/cv199_9721.txt you know the rest . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? 
neg/cv199_9721.txt and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh 
neg/cv199_9721.txt please ! 
neg/cv199_9721.txt kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt two , the script has no sense of humour . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt three , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt we can't feel her rage . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? 
neg/cv199_9721.txt not much , and you can hardly blame him . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt but the script is beyond rescue . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt complacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . . 
neg/cv199_9721.txt  . 


neg/cv207_29141.txt

neg/cv207_29141.txt for " original sin , " the road to the screen has been rocky . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt so is " original sin " really all that bad ? 
neg/cv207_29141.txt yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the " t " and antonio banderas the " a " ) . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the " let's go laugh at the failings of others " mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt but things are different this summer . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt  " original sin " will never join such treasures as " valley of the dolls , " " road house " and " showgirls " in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , " waltz into darkness " ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , " mississippi mermaid " ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , " this is not a love story , it is a story about love . " 
neg/cv207_29141.txt wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , " we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . " 
neg/cv207_29141.txt after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt incidentally , if you're afraid i'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie " 61 * " ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can't have her , he will kill her . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt oh , the pathos of it all . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt as for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt his most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . 
neg/cv207_29141.txt and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them " original sin . " 


neg/cv200_29006.txt

neg/cv200_29006.txt capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt that makes it a film without much center . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt  , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
neg/cv200_29006.txt pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the final irony of the original version has become film history . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt  ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) 
neg/cv200_29006.txt he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt and the language they talk is earth- english . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt she is bent on making the world a better place . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt this is a further abandonment of the source material . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i didn't like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt this tends to limit close looks at the makeup . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in general it seems much improved from 1968 . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt these visuals work nicely . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt apes spring incredible distances . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt but he delivers them very well . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . 
neg/cv200_29006.txt i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv453_10911.txt

neg/cv453_10911.txt i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt that's not a good sign . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt back to the store . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 
neg/cv453_10911.txt nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt talk about coitus interruptus . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
neg/cv453_10911.txt at the extreme . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) 
neg/cv453_10911.txt does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? 
neg/cv453_10911.txt why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? 
neg/cv453_10911.txt if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? 
neg/cv453_10911.txt these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . 
neg/cv453_10911.txt i refer you to the first paragraph of this review . 


neg/cv726_4365.txt

neg/cv726_4365.txt cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the " money train " --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history ! 
neg/cv726_4365.txt he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets ! 
neg/cv726_4365.txt but this is only one of money train's problems . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt the film isn't all bad though . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this . 
neg/cv726_4365.txt but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here . 


neg/cv519_16239.txt

neg/cv519_16239.txt terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt unfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt the best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt instead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt with a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt hopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film . 
neg/cv519_16239.txt i give this film . 


neg/cv245_8938.txt

neg/cv245_8938.txt as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt  " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt in " mimic " , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt there's nothing new in " mimic " . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt the switch is to your right ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt use common sense ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt just do it ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt  " hmmm . . . . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt  " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i shouldn't blame del toro . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . " 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america ! 
neg/cv245_8938.txt i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt do you speak english ? 
neg/cv245_8938.txt now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt just remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up . 
neg/cv245_8938.txt if you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time . "
