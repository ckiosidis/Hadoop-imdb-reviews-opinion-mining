neg/cv788_26409.txt remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? 
neg/cv788_26409.txt  " pulp fiction " and " fargo " both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing " the way of the gun " that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote " the usual suspects , " which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that " if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . " 
neg/cv788_26409.txt with " the way of the gun " mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the " bag man " ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing ) . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about " the business " and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt it's like a dream without any appeal . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don't move . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country's army . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt if they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . 
neg/cv788_26409.txt i can't say either for " the way of the gun , " because it has very little going for it and i can't imagine anyone intelligently defending it . 


neg/cv313_19337.txt

neg/cv313_19337.txt let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore's 007 . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt it's as much of a mess as it sounds . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt bond is " helped " in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn't possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt scaramanga's lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the " action " is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die " fame " ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga's " funhouse " . 
neg/cv313_19337.txt the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior " the spy who loved me " ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . 


neg/cv915_9342.txt

neg/cv915_9342.txt there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt here's what happens this time . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt it's night at the white house . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt how do we know he's a hotshot ? 
neg/cv915_9342.txt we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt a very dangerous liaison . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt well , not really , i just wanted to say that . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt the " 1600 " in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . 
neg/cv915_9342.txt serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !

neg/cv492_19370.txt the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt what the film is not , however , is funny . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt the plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt i wish i had stuck to my first impression . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt and he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt but the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt after some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt the director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one's who have yet to discover literacy . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) . ' 
neg/cv492_19370.txt if you see the film and you find you're not laughing , there is nothing wrong with you . 
neg/cv492_19370.txt it just means you grew up since seventh grade .

neg/cv003_12683.txt  " quest for camelot " is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney's " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt this year , it's no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt  " quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt there's nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt  ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt i rest my case . ) 
neg/cv003_12683.txt even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt in the end , it's a tie -- they all win . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . 
neg/cv003_12683.txt aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot " 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality .

neg/cv381_21673.txt for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt france was involved in " the hundred years war " against england .

neg/cv381_21673.txt he does . . . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt and she does . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable .

neg/cv381_21673.txt ms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt her joan is unbalanced , " inspiring " the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed .

neg/cv381_21673.txt an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . 
neg/cv381_21673.txt the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival .

neg/cv381_21673.txt dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her " revelations . " 
neg/cv381_21673.txt as well she should .

neg/cv381_21673.txt as a messenger , she was quite effective .

neg/cv784_16077.txt and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the " bad guy " ) . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt the plotting of " varsity blues " is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's " all the right moves . " 
neg/cv784_16077.txt one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's " dawson's creek " ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and " by-the-numbers " screenplay by w . peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in " all the right moves . " 
neg/cv784_16077.txt the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt smart does not allow her character to become the " passive girlfriend , " instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt his mother stands beside her " big , strong husband " and is a passive female . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt saving " varsity blues " from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? 
neg/cv784_16077.txt i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt do we really need another high-school sports film ? 
neg/cv784_16077.txt no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . 
neg/cv784_16077.txt  " varsity blues , " no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . 


neg/cv723_9002.txt

neg/cv723_9002.txt chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt i think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in " the fifth element " as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle " money talks " just doesn't do him service . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt in fact , if you see " money talks , " it should shock you beyond recognition that two of " toy story " 's writers penned the sloppy script . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt tucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt but villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt the local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt this means james must present his new " friend " in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt  " this ain't no buddy movie , " claim the print ads . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt yeah , right . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears " money talks " has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt this is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt but you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing " money talks " has going for it . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with " money talks . " 
neg/cv723_9002.txt the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when " nothing to lose " employed it last month . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt the villains , as many as there are , are dull . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt certain story elements are too coincidental . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt and too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( " you brought a killer into my parents' house ! " ) 
neg/cv723_9002.txt is extremely silly . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt you get the picture . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt obviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at " money talks . " 
neg/cv723_9002.txt but the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . 
neg/cv723_9002.txt tucker's audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like " money talks . " 
neg/cv723_9002.txt those who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails .

neg/cv683_13047.txt a friend invites you to a movie . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt you accept . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_ . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_ . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt oh , woe . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt your hope has sunk . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt why was this movie made ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt why was it released ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt what is the point of this ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt does it make any sense ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt is it supposed to be funny ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt when the daughter stands up to the bully at school . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt when birdy almost loses her job . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt when someone dies . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt who can survive such a debacle ? 
neg/cv683_13047.txt i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt harry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! 
neg/cv683_13047.txt gena rowlands is the best part of the film . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt have you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt  ( 2 ) you've had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the candlelight appear like little " x " s . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt you're not a bad director , but you can't change a terrible script . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt there's a recurring scene where birdy , working at the neighborhood fotomat , finds the machine go wrong , and image after destroyed , warped , dark image appear . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt think about it . 
neg/cv683_13047.txt a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie .

neg/cv400_20631.txt the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt i have never liked john carpenter and his style . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt john carpenter remains john carpenter . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt but there are some things that are interesting . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the " breed of evil " . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt the other cast members are struggling . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat . 
neg/cv400_20631.txt still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience .
