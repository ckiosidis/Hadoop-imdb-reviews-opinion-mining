pos/cv968_24218.txt insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! 
pos/cv968_24218.txt musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- " south park " parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! 
pos/cv968_24218.txt also offers up some pretty decent laughs . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt jason mchugh's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt as i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt you'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every " south park " episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt other songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale ) . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt thankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt released as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt as for the dvd . . . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt well , that's a different story . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt probably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the musical ! 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the dvd is a massive achievement . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt presented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! 
pos/cv968_24218.txt specific extras . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i've ever seen on any disc . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt the picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt there's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt it's good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . 
pos/cv968_24218.txt kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time .

pos/cv239_3385.txt the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt did dolores kill her husband ? 
pos/cv239_3385.txt and did she kill her employer ? 
pos/cv239_3385.txt dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt kathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt the rest of the cast is also very good . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt judy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt however , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt however , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . 
pos/cv239_3385.txt on my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . 


pos/cv960_29007.txt

pos/cv960_29007.txt gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in " session 9 . " 
pos/cv960_29007.txt gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt i don't want to give away too much of the story of " session 9 , " so i'll stop there . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of " halloween " and " friday the thirteenth . " 
pos/cv960_29007.txt there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is " frightening . " 
pos/cv960_29007.txt as i watched " session 9 " i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his " next stop wonderland " ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of " the shining , " " the blair witch project " and , even " the texas chainsaw massacre " and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt acting is another factor that raises " session 9 " above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like " scream , " " i know what you did last summer " and their sequels . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt he made the jump from tv's " nypd blue " to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous " jade " ) were less than star making . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt the only problem with " session 9 " lay in the uninspired ending . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film 
pos/cv960_29007.txt  " session 9 " is an unusual feat . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt it is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . 
pos/cv960_29007.txt i give it a b+ . 


pos/cv479_5649.txt

pos/cv479_5649.txt 50's `aliens vs . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt earth' idea revamped ! 
pos/cv479_5649.txt if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt id4 is a movie for all . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . 
pos/cv479_5649.txt this film is best watched on the big-screen .

pos/cv164_22447.txt this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt `a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : 
pos/cv164_22447.txt 1 ) period detail . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt 2 ) mom and dad . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt which brings us to . . . . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt 3 ) the comic situations . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt not only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition . 
pos/cv164_22447.txt why don't you ? 


pos/cv111_11473.txt

pos/cv111_11473.txt >from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt the concept is deceptively pedestrian . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . 
pos/cv111_11473.txt drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .

pos/cv525_16122.txt it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt he loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced .

pos/cv525_16122.txt he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt this sets the tone for the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt irony would be an injustice . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt situations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt the emotions are authentic . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt all this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt if most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt i have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt there is no selling point . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt the characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt this does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt it engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt the only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . 
pos/cv525_16122.txt their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a " feel-good " ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . 


pos/cv631_4967.txt

pos/cv631_4967.txt what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! 
pos/cv631_4967.txt i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : " first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! " 
pos/cv631_4967.txt and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ) . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! 
pos/cv631_4967.txt but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! 
pos/cv631_4967.txt keaton delivers . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as " the dark knight returns " and " the killing joke . " 
pos/cv631_4967.txt burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt nicholson isn't joking when he boasts , " wait 'till they get a load of me ! " 
pos/cv631_4967.txt his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt batman's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt production designer anton furst's sets are a wonder . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the movie's gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt as i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt in terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt more than anything , batman is a mood film . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt while batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . 
pos/cv631_4967.txt thanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world .

pos/cv045_23923.txt -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . 
pos/cv045_23923.txt i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .

pos/cv946_18658.txt star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
pos/cv946_18658.txt review by matt pusateri 
pos/cv946_18658.txt few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt arguably , more americans today can explain what " the force " or a " jedi " is than a budget deficit or a serb . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
pos/cv946_18658.txt can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
pos/cv946_18658.txt against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt qui-gon senses the child is " unusually strong " with the force and begins to suspect that he may be " the one " prophesized to " bring balance to the force . " 
pos/cv946_18658.txt as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but the complexity is not overwhelming . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt it's unclear whose story phantom menace is . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is " the one . " 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing " destroyers " on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt each location is elaborate and complex . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a " roger rabbit " -like presence . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and " the force , " like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the phantom menace won't win any major oscars . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt it probably won't beat titanic's box office record . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt but it's still worth seeing . . . 
pos/cv946_18658.txt probably more than once .
