neg/cv953_7078.txt capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt simmer for 100 minutes . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt yields : zilch . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt it's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt it's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the film opens up with a " prelude " sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from " sorcerer " as well ! 
neg/cv953_7078.txt sorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt anyway , the cinematic theft doesn't stop there . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt or at least the lack of inspiration . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt there isn't a single thing here we haven't seen , and it's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt we have ( where's my list ? ) 
neg/cv953_7078.txt a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt no than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt what else is there ? 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the plot is a waste of time . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure once mike and the 'bots get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another . 
neg/cv953_7078.txt all i can say is that i pray this isn't the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie .

neg/cv209_28973.txt it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt  " kiss of the dragon " is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . 
neg/cv209_28973.txt no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .

neg/cv095_28730.txt gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . " 
neg/cv095_28730.txt tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ? 
neg/cv095_28730.txt it's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ? 
neg/cv095_28730.txt a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness . 
neg/cv095_28730.txt while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .

neg/cv504_29120.txt american pie 2 is filled with laughs . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt of the original , i noted it was " a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . " 
neg/cv504_29120.txt well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt as usual nothing goes right until the last reel . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt for the most part , they are not shown as individuals . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt the sequel is more cynical . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt the only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt in the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt it is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . 
neg/cv504_29120.txt american pie 2 is funny , but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown .

neg/cv430_18662.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
neg/cv430_18662.txt the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt but that's just it- scenes . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt i mean , was this really necessary ? 
neg/cv430_18662.txt couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? 
neg/cv430_18662.txt i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? 
neg/cv430_18662.txt particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? 
neg/cv430_18662.txt that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . 
neg/cv430_18662.txt still , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? 
neg/cv430_18662.txt at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked .

neg/cv678_14887.txt although he is top-billed , here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum , who plays ricky hayman , the programming director at a home shopping network . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt sales are way down , and ricky's job hangs by a thread until he meets g ( murphy ) , a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation , the reinvigorated ricky's greed grows , endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant ( kelly preston ) . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt writer tom schulman has some promising ideas , satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt the sluggishly paced _holy_man_ is not only slow and overlong ( 113 minutes ) , but an unfunny bore , and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings ; cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that made him a star ( g is , for the most part , a straight man ) , he is a curiously lifeless presence . 
neg/cv678_14887.txt goldblum is actually quite good , but it's hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesn't seem to be much interested , either .

neg/cv266_26644.txt the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company . 
neg/cv266_26644.txt of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe . 
neg/cv266_26644.txt the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair . 
neg/cv266_26644.txt the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp . 
neg/cv266_26644.txt the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother . 
neg/cv266_26644.txt charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .

neg/cv223_28923.txt they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . " 
neg/cv223_28923.txt are you still with me ? 
neg/cv223_28923.txt there's only a little more . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt aki is infected with the alien force . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt dr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won't hold much longer . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in " aliens . " 
neg/cv223_28923.txt capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt so there you have it . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt like most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt but i'm bored with apocalyptic settings . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? 
neg/cv223_28923.txt the action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we're missing ) . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960's " the time machine . " 
neg/cv223_28923.txt drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind " final fantasy : the spirits within , " but i found it sub-par across the board . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt  " futurama " does more effective battle visuals , the kids in " south park " are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of " the outer limits " does better doom and gloom sci-fi . 
neg/cv223_28923.txt so who needs this ? 
neg/cv223_28923.txt not me .

neg/cv304_28489.txt tomb raider . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt fun ? 
neg/cv304_28489.txt exciting ? 
neg/cv304_28489.txt challenging ? 
neg/cv304_28489.txt given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff , pistol packin' babe who raids , well . . . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt tombs , you have to believe it's these three things and more ! 
neg/cv304_28489.txt  " lara croft : tomb raider , " the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for " girl , interrupted " no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt it isn't fun , it isn't exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark ) . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to " con air , " " tomb raider " is an empty-headed , big budget bore . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys " hudson hawk " ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well . . . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt who the heck cares ? ) and it makes " super mario bros . " ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like " rocco and his brothers " ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms . croft hails from england's green and pleasant ) . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt ok , let's forget challenging . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt shouldn't " tomb raider " be , at the very least , fun and exciting ? 
neg/cv304_28489.txt shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ? 
neg/cv304_28489.txt there's no humor to be found anywhere in " tomb raider , " even though it tries hard from time to time . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt even " the mummy returns " didn't take itself too seriously . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt to liven things up ( perhaps ) , jolie's live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara's dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt one thing i hadn't expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-looking moustache he's forced to wear gets in the way some ) . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt unsuccessful ? not entirely . 
neg/cv304_28489.txt if anything , " lara croft : tomb raider " makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about . 


neg/cv008_29326.txt

neg/cv008_29326.txt call it a road trip for the walking wounded . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt  ( only in the movies , right ? ) 
neg/cv008_29326.txt too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt ain't they a pair ? 
neg/cv008_29326.txt unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt this revelation exists purely for its own sake . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt aberdeen doesn't know where else to go . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt it's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt despite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . 
neg/cv008_29326.txt when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? 
neg/cv008_29326.txt the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! " 
neg/cv008_29326.txt even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .
