pos/cv754_7216.txt kolya is one of the richest films i've seen in some time . 
pos/cv754_7216.txt zdenek sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor ( who's likely to remain so ) , who finds his life as a czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five-year old boy that he's taking care of . 
pos/cv754_7216.txt though it ends rather abruptly-- and i'm whining , 'cause i wanted to spend more time with these characters-- the acting , writing , and production values are as high as , if not higher than , comparable american dramas . 
pos/cv754_7216.txt this father-and-son delight-- sverak also wrote the script , while his son , jan , directed-- won a golden globe for best foreign language film and , a couple days after i saw it , walked away an oscar .

pos/cv606_15985.txt synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt comments : " star trek : the next generation " was a hugely successful sequel tv series to " star trek , " a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt even though it still enjoyed high ratings , " star trek : the next generation " ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original " star trek " 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt star trek : insurrection is the ninth " star trek " movie and the third to focus on the " star trek : the next generation " crew . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between " okay " and " good . " 
pos/cv606_15985.txt after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant " star trek : voyager " tv series , " star trek " fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt most people reading this probably haven't followed " star trek " anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt okay . let's move to the movie itself . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt sound pretty heavy ? 
pos/cv606_15985.txt it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt  ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) 
pos/cv606_15985.txt donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . 
pos/cv606_15985.txt rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . 


pos/cv506_15956.txt

pos/cv506_15956.txt much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of " lolita , " made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , 
pos/cv506_15956.txt you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt what's even worse is that seeing this " lolita , " especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything " lolita , " is admittingly very anticlimactic . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : " flashdance , " " fatal attraction , " and " indecent proposal " ) , at least besides " jacob's ladder . " 
pos/cv506_15956.txt i've seen this " lolita " twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
pos/cv506_15956.txt this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and 
pos/cv506_15956.txt when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt some of that is in the casting of the two leads . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . 
pos/cv506_15956.txt by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .

pos/cv676_21090.txt in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt if you haven't yet seen it , go see it . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt now . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you've seen it , come back . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt i'll wait here . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt welcome back . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt if you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , 
pos/cv676_21090.txt i'm sure you've just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt it's humorous but it isn't funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year's very best . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt he is living life without a purpose . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt he is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt he barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt but one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter's ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt what he sees is the performance by his daughter's friend , the head cheerleader . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt but for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt this crush is only the beginning . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( " today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? " ) , 
pos/cv676_21090.txt buying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be " beauty " ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt his new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt and the burnhams's neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film's thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt colonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt kevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt he never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt equally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt at two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn't feel nearly long enough . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt it's a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt powerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt it claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt the dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it's all over . 
pos/cv676_21090.txt american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it's a masterpiece . 


pos/cv413_7398.txt

pos/cv413_7398.txt  " psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt and the soundtrack ? 
pos/cv413_7398.txt it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt and the colours ! 
pos/cv413_7398.txt deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . 
pos/cv413_7398.txt the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .

pos/cv912_5674.txt review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt michael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt frank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt when dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt so when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt the movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt the mix between these genres are perfect . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt michael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt alvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt and jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt the frighteners never once feels like it is running long . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt this movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . 
pos/cv912_5674.txt it's easily the best film of the year , so far .

pos/cv485_26649.txt just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt with all of the attention thrown to " family films " in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt nightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping " sandy claws , " employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt he then aims to take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt alas , the co-mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie 
pos/cv485_26649.txt tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee-wee's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it's simple yet compelling story . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt it's not just child's play for the holidays ; it's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise . 
pos/cv485_26649.txt what better message is there for christmas ? 


pos/cv414_10518.txt

pos/cv414_10518.txt jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt  ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) 
pos/cv414_10518.txt tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she " borrows " max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 
pos/cv414_10518.txt by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt at least this film has a little imagination . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt most of the performances in jackie brown are above par . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , " little bit , " and " pretty much . " 
pos/cv414_10518.txt fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt we look at the screen and think , " gee , that's clever , " and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt this is a tribute to both direction and acting . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these " offensive " words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . 
pos/cv414_10518.txt go see the film and see what i mean . 


pos/cv327_20292.txt

pos/cv327_20292.txt review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt  ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) 
pos/cv327_20292.txt not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt  ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) 
pos/cv327_20292.txt but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt  ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
pos/cv327_20292.txt will patrasche save the day ? 
pos/cv327_20292.txt will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
pos/cv327_20292.txt a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt not that they are the only good stars , however . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt  ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) 
pos/cv327_20292.txt also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt he's another one of my favorite characters in the film . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt this one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt that , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt eleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt its heart is in the right place and it engages you . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt you can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' 
pos/cv327_20292.txt in addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt other critics , however , were not so kind . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt stephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt he found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' 
pos/cv327_20292.txt in addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' 
pos/cv327_20292.txt there have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt my suggestion : disregard the critics . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt they just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt this dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt this is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt it is also one of the better family films around this year . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt none of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt if you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt go see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt see it while you can . 
pos/cv327_20292.txt there is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie .

pos/cv315_11629.txt confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt i don't know why , really . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes . . . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
pos/cv315_11629.txt maybe that's going a little bit too far . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt but . . . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the parallels are there . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt ok , maybe that's not enough parallels . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt so titanic's not in gwtw's league . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt no matter . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the money was obviously well-spent . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt he succeeds masterfully . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt cameron does two things that work incredibly well . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just " titanic " , not " the titanic " , mind you ) . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt  ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . ) 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the love story itself is rather conventional . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt the performances are the key here . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt he's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not " can i save this little girl ? " , 
pos/cv315_11629.txt but " can she help me get on a lifeboat ? " 
pos/cv315_11629.txt dicaprio is a revelation . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt i hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt  ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) 
pos/cv315_11629.txt dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt at first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt we know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt it's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . 
pos/cv315_11629.txt cameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .
