neg/cv306_10859.txt here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? 
neg/cv306_10859.txt probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt williams , once a " can't miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt meanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . 
neg/cv306_10859.txt and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . 


neg/cv873_19937.txt

neg/cv873_19937.txt overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel " the haunting of hill house " ) stars lili taylor as one of three " lab rats " that participate in a supposed " insomnia " study being initiated by liam neeson . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of " creepy " cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? 
neg/cv873_19937.txt the original was a great psychological horror film . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt that's too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? 
neg/cv873_19937.txt robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt apparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it's original title . 
neg/cv873_19937.txt i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont's version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

neg/cv498_9288.txt i think we should , as responsible citizens , all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues , epilogues , etc . the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt ho , ho . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt grinding doesn't begin to describe . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that , if you are a normal person , you leave feeling sick . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt when it's not trying to be funny , it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying , stupid and sappy . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt at best . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt this movie is intended to make people laugh , yes , not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt but , it fails on every possible level . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it fails to be funny . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it fails to be insightful . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it fails to be suspensful . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it fails to be fun . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt they should pay people to see it . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles , for having lived . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt if you go in with the intention of coming out alive , please make sure that you are overly fond of boob , fart , pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt yes , literally insane . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt stark , raving mad . 
neg/cv498_9288.txt it is boring , stupid , melodramatic and in the end ugly .

neg/cv076_26009.txt susan granger's review of " the watcher " ( universal ) 
neg/cv076_26009.txt just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . " 
neg/cv076_26009.txt writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . " 
neg/cv076_26009.txt plus , as reeves explains , " we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . " 
neg/cv076_26009.txt after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . 
neg/cv076_26009.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . 


neg/cv376_20883.txt

neg/cv376_20883.txt robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically " uplifting " film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant " heil hitler ! " ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt liberation ! he thinks . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a " holocaust comedy " . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt it's not a comedy . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt is it a melodrama ? 
neg/cv376_20883.txt a war movie ? 
neg/cv376_20883.txt a character study ? 
neg/cv376_20883.txt no , no , and no . 
neg/cv376_20883.txt jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . 


neg/cv122_7891.txt

neg/cv122_7891.txt when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats . " 
neg/cv122_7891.txt i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( " slacker , " " dazed and confused , " " before sunrise , " and " suburbia " . . . all 
neg/cv122_7891.txt which were great ) . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt now , i adore quentin tarantino . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt he made way too many tv appearances . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt and he made this film . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt  ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt pitiful for any director , too . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt i've never seen all of " new york stories , " but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt yea . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt  ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
neg/cv122_7891.txt this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
neg/cv122_7891.txt stuck inside some object in their hotel room . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt yeah , that's what i said . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt not even actually funny for a second . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
neg/cv122_7891.txt another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at " coming back " ) who are playing sex games . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt and david proval has never overacted as much . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt and it's " pulp fiction " producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek 
neg/cv122_7891.txt would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? 
neg/cv122_7891.txt nope . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt oh ! 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it 
neg/cv122_7891.txt was okay . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) 
neg/cv122_7891.txt ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt they also pay him a lot of cash . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt it took quentin to realize that . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but this sucked . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt that makes no sense . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt it's long and it's just not very good . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt conclusion : what's the moral here ? 
neg/cv122_7891.txt if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . " 
neg/cv122_7891.txt i seem to respect directors if they aren't " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes . 
neg/cv122_7891.txt  " the man from hollywood " is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously .

neg/cv769_8565.txt phew , what a mess ! 
neg/cv769_8565.txt for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt is one of jerry's conjectures correct ? 
neg/cv769_8565.txt  * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? 
neg/cv769_8565.txt is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? 
neg/cv769_8565.txt is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? 
neg/cv769_8565.txt no , no , and no . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt  ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . ) 
neg/cv769_8565.txt the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt  ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? ) 
neg/cv769_8565.txt even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt  ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . ) 
neg/cv769_8565.txt other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt  ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . ) 
neg/cv769_8565.txt let's see , other pleasures include . . . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt a brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt oh , pretty woman ! 
neg/cv769_8565.txt getting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt and here i thought it was wabbit season . 
neg/cv769_8565.txt good god , who rewrites these movies ? 
neg/cv769_8565.txt and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ?

neg/cv690_5425.txt i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
neg/cv690_5425.txt gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says " he's not my son . " 
neg/cv690_5425.txt obviously . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him " wear " his spoon ( " you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . " 
neg/cv690_5425.txt decisions , decisions . . . ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( " your i . q . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt test went straight off the chart ! " ) 
neg/cv690_5425.txt and attracts electrical power . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt goldblum plugs in a " jacob's ladder " device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months ) . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance . 
neg/cv690_5425.txt i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened .

neg/cv666_20301.txt

neg/cv666_20301.txt when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt the latter's the case with john mctiernan and " the thirteenth warrior , " which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan's " the thomas crown affair " remake , a flick that got good reviews . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt you don't have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that " thirteenth " won't be so lucky . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose " eaters of the dead " novel provides " warrior " 's source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like " braveheart " without any of the passion . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt but the bloodshed certainly remains : there's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt the good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt they're also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt you'll wince , you'll groan , you'll grouse , " haven't we seen this guy killed twice before ? " 
neg/cv666_20301.txt banderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt he's not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don't exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and " the thirteenth warrior " wisely doesn't pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt let the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there's still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt it isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( " funny girl " ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic " indiana jones and the temple of doom " -esque chase through the villains' underground lair . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between " die hard " -helmer mctiernan and " jurrasic park " -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt heard during " the thirteenth warrior " 's final scene : a dog whimpering . 
neg/cv666_20301.txt how appropriate . 


neg/cv528_11669.txt

neg/cv528_11669.txt here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? 
neg/cv528_11669.txt done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt unfortunately , it isn't . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt it certainly would have been more entertaining . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt it starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . 
neg/cv528_11669.txt parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first .
