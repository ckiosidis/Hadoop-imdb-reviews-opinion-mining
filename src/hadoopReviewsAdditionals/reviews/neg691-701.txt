neg/cv290_11981.txt billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt he tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt he's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt but in a turn of bad luck , sammy wrecks his car . . . only 
neg/cv290_11981.txt to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheorghe muresan ) . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt but this giant has a heart of gold . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt he leads a solitary life , helping out the monks at a local monastery . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt his only longing is for his long lost love , lilianna ( joanna pacula ) , who has since moved to america . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt sammy , seeing a golden ticket , convinces max to become an actor ( represented by sammy , of course ) , and come back to america . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job , with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max's nose . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt but slowly sammy's deceptions begin to haunt him . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt the humor in my giant isn't the world's greatest . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt mostly , it falls under the category of " boy . . . he's 
neg/cv290_11981.txt so big ! " , 
neg/cv290_11981.txt and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt the film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt between executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor ! 
neg/cv290_11981.txt gheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn't help . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something 
neg/cv290_11981.txt muresan should have studied for some pointers . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ? 
neg/cv290_11981.txt he's proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back . 
neg/cv290_11981.txt that doesn't mean we have to .

neg/cv935_24977.txt the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt he's just big momma without the makeup on . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . 
neg/cv935_24977.txt it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .

neg/cv101_10537.txt my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt what an auspicious beginning ! 
neg/cv101_10537.txt welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . " 
neg/cv101_10537.txt we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . " 
neg/cv101_10537.txt having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? 
neg/cv101_10537.txt she has only seconds to decide who will be saved . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt  ( " hoods in the woods , " is what the " ground-pounders " yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) 
neg/cv101_10537.txt along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . " 
neg/cv101_10537.txt firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . 
neg/cv101_10537.txt it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .

neg/cv665_29386.txt synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt soon , julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it's unlikely that " original sin " could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt this is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt that said , " original sin " could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt the result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt cristofer doesn't even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren't being given the chance . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt the same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent . 
neg/cv665_29386.txt also unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film's denouement . 


neg/cv211_9955.txt

neg/cv211_9955.txt tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt of course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt it's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt there also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , 
neg/cv211_9955.txt the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt and although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt however , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt in fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt the humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt the characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' 
neg/cv211_9955.txt nothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . 
neg/cv211_9955.txt he nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose .

neg/cv107_25639.txt --- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl .

neg/cv107_25639.txt i love superman iii . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise .

neg/cv107_25639.txt selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt ok . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt huh ? 
neg/cv107_25639.txt why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
neg/cv107_25639.txt attention movie : explain yourself ! 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
neg/cv107_25639.txt lois lane's sister , lucy . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt there is some credit to give to the film however . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt then there were numerous little things that bothered me . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 
neg/cv107_25639.txt a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt finally , just one word : monsters . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! " 
neg/cv107_25639.txt at one point ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt believability aside though , it's still annoying . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! 
neg/cv107_25639.txt they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the transfer on this international version is incredible . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt you'd think you were watching a new release . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt one question though . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt ugh , i give up . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . 
neg/cv107_25639.txt supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

neg/cv155_7845.txt

neg/cv155_7845.txt  " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt this movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt i'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt actually , it's almost funny in a way . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt what is the point of this ? 
neg/cv155_7845.txt maybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn't see that one coming ! ) , 
neg/cv155_7845.txt starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt and gordy ! 
neg/cv155_7845.txt of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn't that evil . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt it's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented and stupid . 
neg/cv155_7845.txt at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . " 
neg/cv155_7845.txt but it's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

neg/cv669_24318.txt

neg/cv669_24318.txt ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the story is very minimal and basic . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt sounds great huh , well it's not . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt now what didn't work in this movie ? 
neg/cv669_24318.txt that would be the rest of it . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt i like wrestling . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt i watch it at home and laugh . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the movie was too dim-witted to be funny . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's " bawitdaba " and " cowboy " . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt it's utterly ridiculous . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt oh and the girls are hotter . 
neg/cv669_24318.txt is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ? 
neg/cv669_24318.txt don't waste your money . 


neg/cv188_20687.txt

neg/cv188_20687.txt an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the writing behind this project is embarrassing . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt for your amusement , i will explain the plot . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! 
neg/cv188_20687.txt  ( a far superior film in any league ) . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt i suppose they are . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt anything to avoid this painful movie . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . 
neg/cv188_20687.txt sequel ? 
neg/cv188_20687.txt please have mercy .
