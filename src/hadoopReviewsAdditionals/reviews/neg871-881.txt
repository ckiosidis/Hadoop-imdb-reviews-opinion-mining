neg/cv954_19932.txt a new entry in the " revisionist history " genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of " deep throat " . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad " dick " joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt the band manages to stop right as dunst screams " you have to stop letting dick run your life ! " 
neg/cv954_19932.txt much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt i don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt the only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt those two characters are the sole basis for my rating . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt i'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as " dick and poopie " jokes . 
neg/cv954_19932.txt and that , to me , does not make a funny movie .

neg/cv089_12222.txt tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look ! 
neg/cv089_12222.txt art ! " ) , 
neg/cv089_12222.txt although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt they're not real , sympathetic , or believable . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . 
neg/cv089_12222.txt for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .

neg/cv247_14668.txt i'm not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt alessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt police sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of '80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired " live in the present and for the future " message . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises . 
neg/cv247_14668.txt such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize .

neg/cv774_15488.txt it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt  ( at least in the movies anyway . ) 
neg/cv774_15488.txt it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt never a good thing for a horror film . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt for that matter , they were almost nonexistent . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . 
neg/cv774_15488.txt either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .

neg/cv868_12799.txt aspiring broadway composer robert ( aaron williams ) secretly carries a torch for his best friend , struggling actor marc ( michael shawn lucas ) . 
neg/cv868_12799.txt the problem is , marc only has eyes for " perfect 10s , " which the geeky , insecure robert certainly is not . 
neg/cv868_12799.txt meanwhile , marc's spoiled ( hetero ) female roommate , cynthia ( mara hobel ) , spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown . 
neg/cv868_12799.txt writer-director victor mignatti's " very romantic comedy " ( as the ad campaign states ) is supposed to be ( pardon the pun ) a gay ol' romp , but it's hard to have much fun with these annoying , self-absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems : marc and cynthia have sitcom-level domestic " crises " ( such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious ) ; robert and marc go to acting class ( how riveting ) ; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges ( how original ) . 
neg/cv868_12799.txt but more than anything else , the three whine . 
neg/cv868_12799.txt constantly .

neg/cv868_12799.txt the terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved .

neg/cv459_21834.txt  " . . . because i'm a scientist . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt that's what we do ! " 
neg/cv459_21834.txt --- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt sound familiar ? 
neg/cv459_21834.txt such is the plot of the destination films release of bats . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt dina meyer stars as the " bat specialist " sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt in this respect , the film never disappointed me . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt this film reaches a level that transcends the " so bad it's good " level and borders on the downright insane . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt he is relegated to the " i'm not sticking around here ! " 
neg/cv459_21834.txt character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma ) . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt being able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . 
neg/cv459_21834.txt she's definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . 


neg/cv946_20084.txt

neg/cv946_20084.txt summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) 
neg/cv946_20084.txt before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt there's also a pleasant soundtrack . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt the 'humour' in the film is also very off . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt there's also problems with the plot . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? 
neg/cv946_20084.txt director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . 
neg/cv946_20084.txt it's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .

neg/cv117_25625.txt well , if you're a super smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military , you'd grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt that's right . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in " hollow man " kevin bacon's character opts to commit sex crimes . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt er , it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? 
neg/cv117_25625.txt something sounds horribly wrong already . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt but this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as " basic instinct " and the infamous " showgirls " never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt  " hollow man " features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of " the invisible man . " 
neg/cv117_25625.txt oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of " thermal " shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt since invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is 
neg/cv117_25625.txt simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt as a horror film , " hollow man " is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . 
neg/cv117_25625.txt it's minor verhoeven--and even that's not saying much--and boy is it hollow .

neg/cv560_18608.txt i love movies . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt i really do . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt 'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt way to go liz ! 
neg/cv560_18608.txt for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt before finally giving up and switching off . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt a real dud . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt it's a nice special effect , though . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt or rather , the lack of them . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . ' 
neg/cv560_18608.txt it's insulting . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt yes , men at work . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt yowza ! 
neg/cv560_18608.txt the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . 
neg/cv560_18608.txt thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet . 


neg/cv858_20266.txt

neg/cv858_20266.txt the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
neg/cv858_20266.txt well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt that title would be the confusing . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt first , the house is great- looking . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt the hill house is not eerie . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt ever heard of lili taylor ? 
neg/cv858_20266.txt before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt the plot is terrible . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt the opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt nell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt but , we get zilch for the other four . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt plus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt and the worst part : most horror films have killings . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt for some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt no reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt overall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt bad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt hopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt hopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . 
neg/cv858_20266.txt and hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one .
