pos/cv599_20988.txt kevin smith is like a big kid . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt that is not to say smith's message is a bad one . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt basically , dogmatism is bad . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt the film's humor is uneven . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt but many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt damon and affleck are fairly lackluster . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . 
pos/cv599_20988.txt bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . 


pos/cv881_13254.txt

pos/cv881_13254.txt the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt what does takes place is more based on character development . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt  ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) 
pos/cv881_13254.txt carol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt it's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt set in a small ( fictional ? ) 
pos/cv881_13254.txt town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future . 
pos/cv881_13254.txt interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it . 


pos/cv295_15570.txt

pos/cv295_15570.txt lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt it's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt enemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt reynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt by an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt it's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt the acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt smith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt the supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas . 
pos/cv295_15570.txt this is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking . 


pos/cv310_13091.txt

pos/cv310_13091.txt i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching " the x-files " every sunday night . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt and i love gillian anderson . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the series is strong for a lot of reasons . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it's original ( though it has many ties to " the twilight zone " and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . 
pos/cv310_13091.txt actually , it's nice to see a risk at all . 


pos/cv167_16376.txt

pos/cv167_16376.txt roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt guido wins dora . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt they marry . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt fast forward about five years . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt the winner takes home a tank . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt the price for his victory is most high . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt those who object to it are missing its point . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . 
pos/cv167_16376.txt committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 


pos/cv226_2618.txt

pos/cv226_2618.txt i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt he's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt his loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt during the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt after a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt there is some character development during the film . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt overall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . 
pos/cv226_2618.txt it may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . 


pos/cv449_8785.txt

pos/cv449_8785.txt this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt >from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt  ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . ) 
pos/cv449_8785.txt the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt not a good sign . . . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt something very , very evil . . . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt it is his acting skills that help hold this film together . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! ) 
pos/cv449_8785.txt climaxes i've recently witnessed . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory . 
pos/cv449_8785.txt not for the squemish ! 


pos/cv388_12009.txt

pos/cv388_12009.txt available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley 
pos/cv388_12009.txt f . w . murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the german director of such classics as " sunrise " and " the last laugh " died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt which brings us to " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the plot of " nosferatu . . . " 
pos/cv388_12009.txt is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's " dracula " . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt  ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! ) 
pos/cv388_12009.txt the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock's castle , we hear a well-timed " now you're dead ! " 
pos/cv388_12009.txt from lead singer peter steele . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest " black no . 1 " . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt of course , " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but " mina " --as bram stoker called her--in hutter's letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt coppola's 1992 " bram stoker's dracula " owes a great stylistic debt to murnau's masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms . 
pos/cv388_12009.txt this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored " metropolis " a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks . 


pos/cv462_19350.txt

pos/cv462_19350.txt this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
pos/cv462_19350.txt starring : tom cruise ( dr . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : " traumnovelle " by : arthur schnitzer 
pos/cv462_19350.txt this is an interesting film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the translation , " dream novel , " makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt 16 months for this ? 
pos/cv462_19350.txt wow . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt reflection is the biggest killer for this film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the " austin powers " version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt spoilers below : 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt they both discover that they both knew about the flirting . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt he sees " opportunity " as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt seeing another " opportunity " arise , he follows the hooker home . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt bill is intrigued and wants to go to one . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt after partaking in some strange " religious " right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt this is only about 100 minutes at this point . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt it's got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt but they all serve to show why they are bad in one's life . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt i recommend this film highly on many merits . 
pos/cv462_19350.txt cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself . 


pos/cv276_15684.txt

pos/cv276_15684.txt  " living out loud , " is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt  " living out loud , " which was written by richard lagravenese ( " the bridges of madison county " ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's " the piano , " for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt she finds the right note for each scene and holds it . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , " happy " ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt the last shot is an especially powerful image . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . 
pos/cv276_15684.txt and as , " living out loud , " which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for .
