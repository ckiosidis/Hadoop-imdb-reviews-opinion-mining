pos/cv518_13331.txt first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . " 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt it didn't . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) 
pos/cv518_13331.txt make this fantastic film feel more real . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt ward russell's cinematography is very good . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip 
pos/cv518_13331.txt to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . 
pos/cv518_13331.txt but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . 


pos/cv180_16113.txt

pos/cv180_16113.txt i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt  ( huh ? ) 
pos/cv180_16113.txt well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? 
pos/cv180_16113.txt a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt oh , and its much better than any of those . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . 
pos/cv180_16113.txt but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . 


pos/cv243_20728.txt

pos/cv243_20728.txt although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) 
pos/cv243_20728.txt ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt all done in a comic fashion , of course . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt billy crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt he's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt he's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) 
pos/cv243_20728.txt the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt there's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt harold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt the script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt the film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt analyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) 
pos/cv243_20728.txt crystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . 
pos/cv243_20728.txt it's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated . 


pos/cv175_6964.txt

pos/cv175_6964.txt capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt  ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) 
pos/cv175_6964.txt the plot is simple but not simpleminded . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt in other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( " by an all-white jury " , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt there's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt in one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt we're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt one scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt another note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind . 
pos/cv175_6964.txt ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . 


pos/cv390_11345.txt

pos/cv390_11345.txt melvin udall is a heartless man . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt he spends his days inside of his spacious manhattan apartment writing romance novels . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt it also seems that melvin will never change . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt one day he dines ar his favorite restaurant , and is a little too mean to his normal waitress ( the only waittress that will serve him ) , carol ( played to perfection by a lovely and sexy helen hunt . ) 
pos/cv390_11345.txt she threatens not to serve him if he doesn't shut up about her asthmatic son . he does shut up . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt to make matters considerably worse , melvin has obsessive compulsive disorder . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt one day his gay artist neighbor simon ( greg kinear , of talk soup fame , in an oscar-worthy role ) 's dog threatens to dismiss himself at melvon's door . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt the dog meets the garbage chute . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt soon simon is sadly beaten by thieveing burglars , and ray ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , simon's agent , takes the dog , verdell , to melvin , so that melvin can dogsit him . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt and through the dog and a rather heartwrenching car trip that involves simon , carol , and himself , melvin learns to emerge from his cantakerous shell . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt jack nicholson gives yet another oscar-caliber performance as the film's cynical lead , and is back at work , not playing a goofy u . s . president or a comic book villian , but instead playing jack nicjolson , and playing him full force . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt all of this adds up to this year's funniest comedy , a creative , witty , and scathing film from james l . brooks , and brooks gets award-worthy performances from the entire cast . 
pos/cv390_11345.txt a winner in every aspect , and a truly delicious slice of cyncial life . 


pos/cv494_17389.txt

pos/cv494_17389.txt i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt and i think that lumet's " 12 angry men " , wilder's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt the film is set in burma in 1943 . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt  ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) 
pos/cv494_17389.txt that means , the picture isn't perfect . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt but it has a lot of virtues as well . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt it shows the " madness " of war and what war can produce in people's minds . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt and " the bridge on the river kwai " is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt the other actors deliver very good performances as well . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . 
pos/cv494_17389.txt i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

pos/cv779_17881.txt

pos/cv779_17881.txt recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt each review compared this film to the truman show . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt why ? 
pos/cv779_17881.txt the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt the same goes for the thin red line , as well . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt this is why i think pleasantville was underrated . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt with the exception of don knotts as the annoying " tv repairman " the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom " pleasantville " to escape from his feuding parents . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as " like " , " whatever " , and " cool " make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt their new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt it's just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don't want it to end . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt  " mary sue " has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt soon we learn that these people don't know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color .

pos/cv779_17881.txt entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , " none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . " 
pos/cv779_17881.txt yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . 
pos/cv779_17881.txt but the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it's what i least expected .

pos/cv266_25779.txt it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt until now . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a " cleaner . " 
pos/cv266_25779.txt she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed " too explicit . " 
pos/cv266_25779.txt i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . 
pos/cv266_25779.txt my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .

pos/cv602_8300.txt everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt good ! 
pos/cv602_8300.txt that's what you're supposed to do ! 
pos/cv602_8300.txt oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt pulp fiction ) . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt drew also has the famous " dueling banjos " competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt while attempting to make a quick " paddle for it " , both canoes tip over . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt this leaves ed and bobby . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment " i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing " will have more meaning in the future . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . 
pos/cv602_8300.txt it's definitely one of those " must see " movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . 


pos/cv857_15958.txt

pos/cv857_15958.txt what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt the thin red line is flawed but it provokes . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt unlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt one message is not necessarily more correct than the other . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt it just depends on one's point of view . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt in malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? 
pos/cv857_15958.txt in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt all that separates them is war . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt instead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt aside from that , malick's direction is stunning . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt ultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . 
pos/cv857_15958.txt has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? 
pos/cv857_15958.txt what malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .
