neg/cv160_10848.txt deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? 
neg/cv160_10848.txt writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound . 
neg/cv160_10848.txt but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .

neg/cv947_11316.txt what were they thinking ? 
neg/cv947_11316.txt nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? 
neg/cv947_11316.txt robbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he's singing at weddings and having a good time . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt a romantic at heart , he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high-school sweetie . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt when she leaves him waiting at the altar , his tune changes to " love stinks " . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt he meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role , but there is no spark . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt barrymore doesn't seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it : beauty but no attitude . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt both characters are just there . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt the eighties are shoved in our face . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt references to deloreans , madonna , " dallas " , ivana and donald , burt and loni and " miami vice " get old fast . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn't much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt they're not funny and it doesn't work . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt with change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don't you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino . 
neg/cv947_11316.txt  ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be . ) 


neg/cv062_24556.txt

neg/cv062_24556.txt there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt here's the `plot . ' 
neg/cv062_24556.txt the year is 3000 . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' 
neg/cv062_24556.txt he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! 
neg/cv062_24556.txt and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' 
neg/cv062_24556.txt then there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt why ? 
neg/cv062_24556.txt because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . ' 
neg/cv062_24556.txt terel may be right , you know . 
neg/cv062_24556.txt humans made this movie . 


neg/cv025_29825.txt

neg/cv025_29825.txt one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it's only when things are over that they make sense . " 
neg/cv025_29825.txt whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt but don't fret , it will surface again . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt but you hold hope for some time . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? 
neg/cv025_29825.txt to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt steven spielberg is picked on in particular . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
neg/cv025_29825.txt the days of breathless are no more . 


neg/cv129_18373.txt

neg/cv129_18373.txt plot : based on the wildly popular " jerry springer " tv show , this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the " i slept with my stepfather " segment , and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted " dog " boyfriend . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt critique : the truth is that if i didn't have a day job , i would probably watch the real " jerry springer " show every day . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt i find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt having said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ) , uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn-fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would've guessed that ? ) . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt i wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt unfortunately , it doesn't seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real " jerry springer " reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no laughs , one-dimensional characters , and no fun whatsoever . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati , ohio . 
neg/cv129_18373.txt for this film , he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star , tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn . 


neg/cv755_24881.txt

neg/cv755_24881.txt battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt when were we conquered ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt keep reading ) . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt they grunt and groan and babble about monsters . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt the " monster " turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt the psychlos refer to humans as " man animals " but yet dogs are still " dogs " . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt why aren't they " dog animals " ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt why do i even care at this point ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 
neg/cv755_24881.txt he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt ooooo , scary villain . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt folks , save your cash . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt unless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt that , and a headache . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt [editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt i'm not sure why . . . 
neg/cv755_24881.txt something just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] 


neg/cv274_26379.txt

neg/cv274_26379.txt the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt so i didn't expect too much from this . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but he gets unexpected help from the house itself . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt is that exciting or what ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt  " the blair witch project " , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt and with a $70 mill . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but why give him a more serious material ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt in the end " haunting " will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but this is where the good things end . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt at first you do not know what's going on . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt is this part of the experiment ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt are these hallucinations ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt projections of the subconscience ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt paranoia ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt the house is actually possessed . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
neg/cv274_26379.txt i believe hichock once said that " it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one " . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt they are impossible to take seriously . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's " the shining " , are absolutely baseless . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt  " shining " had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt  " haunting " has only special effects and art direction to boast of . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . 
neg/cv274_26379.txt but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " .

neg/cv404_21805.txt can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ? 
neg/cv404_21805.txt i think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt that's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt and this is supposed to make sense . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt really . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt from the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt the film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac's return excruciatingly boring . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin's unbelievably horrible script , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac's return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt the bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt and what's with that title ? 
neg/cv404_21805.txt the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt let's pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series . 
neg/cv404_21805.txt one of the worst horror films in years . 


neg/cv856_28882.txt

neg/cv856_28882.txt burnt money is the perfect festival film . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt this film from the seattle international film festival 2001's emerging masters series is easily one of the year's worst . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt hiding out in a prostitute's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie's conclusion . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt or something like that . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt clarity isn't exactly this movie's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt not much could have really happened though . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt the main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there's a reason , but there's no purpose to anything in this film . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt it appears pi ? eyro ( who co-wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt burnt money is pointless . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt the performances are bad . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt it tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt god forbid it will ever get a distributor . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt another disappointing film from this year's so-called emerging masters series . 
neg/cv856_28882.txt pass on by .

neg/cv312_29308.txt  " come on , silent bob ! 
neg/cv312_29308.txt we're going to hollywood . " 
neg/cv312_29308.txt starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt directed by kevin smith . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt rated r . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( " what's the internet ? " ) 
neg/cv312_29308.txt are talking trash about them . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ? 
neg/cv312_29308.txt on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ? 
neg/cv312_29308.txt -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt countless " hot " movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt get it ? 
neg/cv312_29308.txt they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey ! 
neg/cv312_29308.txt a monkey ! 
neg/cv312_29308.txt as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? " 
neg/cv312_29308.txt kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt unfortunately , it's also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt smith's " verbal trampoline , " as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker . 
neg/cv312_29308.txt this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible .
