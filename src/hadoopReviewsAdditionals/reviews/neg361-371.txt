neg/cv236_12427.txt working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt the problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of " free lobotomy " lab experiment . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt it's not love at first sight , however . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a " quiet " dinner . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad " white " movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a " black " effort of the same low caliber . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? 
neg/cv236_12427.txt in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt sadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt despite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script . 
neg/cv236_12427.txt since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . 


neg/cv065_16909.txt

neg/cv065_16909.txt movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt so , it does indeed have some plusses . . . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
neg/cv065_16909.txt far too annoying far too often . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt  " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt some people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things ! 
neg/cv065_16909.txt if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well , 
neg/cv065_16909.txt he'd be a good screenwriter . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt instead , this project may have sunk his career . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
neg/cv065_16909.txt script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal's understudy . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's " not a whore " . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt of course she is ! 
neg/cv065_16909.txt she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt we're supposed to root for her . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt no way ! 
neg/cv065_16909.txt she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt it sure ain't character development ! 
neg/cv065_16909.txt plummer also appeared in " speed " in '94 in a smaller , yet better role . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don't learn anything about him . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt is he a villain ? 
neg/cv065_16909.txt who cares ! 
neg/cv065_16909.txt ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? 
neg/cv065_16909.txt it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt oops , they're bad actors , too . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone . 
neg/cv065_16909.txt useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen . 


neg/cv043_16808.txt

neg/cv043_16808.txt  " party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt that's really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt how fun ! 
neg/cv043_16808.txt since , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt it was groan-inducing . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ? 
neg/cv043_16808.txt well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . 
neg/cv043_16808.txt although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . 


neg/cv394_5311.txt

neg/cv394_5311.txt actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt  " baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt a nipple hallucination sort of thing . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt the movie is set in the year 2017 , " the worst year of my life , " pam says . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt  ( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . ) 
neg/cv394_5311.txt america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt but don't call her " babe . " 
neg/cv394_5311.txt she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like " babe " during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt in the words of one of the characters , they're " more than meets the eye . " 
neg/cv394_5311.txt reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt thank god they didn't name her cora reef . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt one bad character name is more than enough . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi " always " video fame . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt it's not rambo . . . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt it's bimbo ! 
neg/cv394_5311.txt mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt barb wire has only two things going for it . . . 
neg/cv394_5311.txt and i think you know what those two things are . 


neg/cv928_9478.txt

neg/cv928_9478.txt martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked " under siege " ) . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt of course , this one , as a change , has a " message " that is drilled into our mind . . . of 
neg/cv928_9478.txt course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt so why do i watch his crap ? 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i usually don't . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . e . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt  " executive decision " ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt  " executive decision " ) . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt but this one has a special place in my heart . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la " mystery science theatre 3000 , " and this was a couple years before i had heard of " mystery science theatre 3000 . " 
neg/cv928_9478.txt in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new " fire down below , " another " message film " ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or 
neg/cv928_9478.txt does he ? 
neg/cv928_9478.txt seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , 
neg/cv928_9478.txt of course . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt he even goes as far as to say , " i don't want to kill someone , " and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i have no problem with violence . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's " con air . " 
neg/cv928_9478.txt but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt as far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt he squints , he kills . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt period . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt nothing else . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt oh , yeah , there's corny one-liners ( " i'm gonna reach out and touch someone ! " ) . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt of course , he's the star , and we're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt michael caine , who's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt he does it well , i guess , but this is no " alfie . " 
neg/cv928_9478.txt of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from " full metal jacket " ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal's ego . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt anyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal's movies is to judge all of them ( except for " under siege " and " executive decision , " though the latter is not really a " seagal movie " ) . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt i mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . 
neg/cv928_9478.txt but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one .

neg/cv028_26964.txt a follow-up to disney's live-action " 101 dalmatians " that's better , more entertaining than the first ? 
neg/cv028_26964.txt just as unlikely . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt with " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt 1996's " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in " men of honor . " 
neg/cv028_26964.txt jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . 
neg/cv028_26964.txt it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying .

neg/cv198_19313.txt this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt ray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you 
neg/cv198_19313.txt should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a " sure thing " at freehold raceway . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? 
neg/cv198_19313.txt the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . 
neg/cv198_19313.txt because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn .

neg/cv033_25680.txt i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! 
neg/cv033_25680.txt we'll have a hit on our hands ! " 
neg/cv033_25680.txt the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt the usual things happen like clockwork . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . 
neg/cv033_25680.txt the replacements offers none of this .

neg/cv146_19587.txt  " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . " 
neg/cv146_19587.txt nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . " 
neg/cv146_19587.txt fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt theo's assessment of the house ? 
neg/cv146_19587.txt  " i love it ! 
neg/cv146_19587.txt sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . " 
neg/cv146_19587.txt who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ? 
neg/cv146_19587.txt  ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) 
neg/cv146_19587.txt both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? 
neg/cv146_19587.txt the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners . 
neg/cv146_19587.txt i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .

neg/cv896_17819.txt what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ? 
neg/cv896_17819.txt a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? 
neg/cv896_17819.txt if you have an answer , let me know . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand-up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt master p stars as fifty dollah' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's " idiot plot , " if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem ) 
neg/cv896_17819.txt so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ? 
neg/cv896_17819.txt not a hell of a lot . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt he acts like the rapper that he is . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt if you haven't yet figured it out , that is not saying much . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand-up and otherwise . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt and indeed , i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here , but from a feature-length movie i expect more . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling " you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush " ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion " huh ? " ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard-earned $8 . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt you'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don't have cable . 
neg/cv896_17819.txt eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away .
