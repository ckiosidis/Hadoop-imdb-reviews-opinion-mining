pos/cv145_11472.txt this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future in-laws . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt williams is excellent as should be no surprise . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt the real star is lane . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt luckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt the question of stereotypes is a touchy one . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt these guys personify the homophobic gay image . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt you can almost hear the swishing . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you'll be outraged . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you'll love it . 
pos/cv145_11472.txt your choice .

pos/cv028_26746.txt  " the blair witch project " was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt after the release of " the blair witch project " , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , " get out of these woods and go home ! 
pos/cv028_26746.txt there is no goddamned blair witch ! " . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called " the blair witch : history or hysteria ? " , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying " the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . " 
pos/cv028_26746.txt this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt documentary director joe berlinger ( " paradice lost " ) helms " blair witch 2 " , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt  " blair witch . . " 
pos/cv028_26746.txt was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the key is simplicity . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt  " blair witch project " had a story which was incredibly simple . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt  " book of shadows " feels incredibly controlled and restrict . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and " clever " that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt in the end , i can't call it a bad effort . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt it's simply different . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt in fact , if you haven't seen " the blair witch project " , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt to me the story of " the blair witch project " seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that " the book of shadows " is certainly assured . 
pos/cv028_26746.txt and it's already time to look forward to " blair witch 3 " . 


pos/cv672_28083.txt

pos/cv672_28083.txt renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as " the umbrellas of cherbourg " and " the young girls of rochefort . " 
pos/cv672_28083.txt the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . ' 
pos/cv672_28083.txt she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . 
pos/cv672_28083.txt it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .

pos/cv527_10123.txt sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist 
pos/cv527_10123.txt by fernando vallejo 
pos/cv527_10123.txt starring bob flanagan and sheree rose . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt produced and directed by kirby dick . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt running time : 90 mins . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt this film is not rated . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt the central themes of " sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist " are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , " sick " chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 " crumb " , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt behold these works of physical art . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt  ) 
pos/cv527_10123.txt but the most outstanding thing about " sick " is flanagan's relationship with sheree . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts " sick " into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous . 
pos/cv527_10123.txt it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy . 


pos/cv386_10080.txt

pos/cv386_10080.txt  " gattaca " represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as " in-valids " and confined to the lower rung of society . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt everyday , he watches as " superior " folk make his fantasy a reality . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt even if " gattaca " were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama " the truman show " ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt as the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it's his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt in " gattaca " 's series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt the big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt still , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it's a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . 
pos/cv386_10080.txt although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , " gattaca " serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . 


pos/cv528_10822.txt

pos/cv528_10822.txt studio expectations must not have been high for " great expectations " -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt  " great expectations " also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's " william shakespeare's romeo + juliet . " 
pos/cv528_10822.txt  " great expectations " opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt but she's not the only ghost from finn's past that's going to be paying him a visit . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt comparisons with the afore-mentioned " romeo + juliet " seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt  " great expectations " is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where " romeo " was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from " gattaca " ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt paltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt alfonso cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren't familiar with the story . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt despite its script flaws , though , " great expectations " is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . 
pos/cv528_10822.txt and frankly , it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality .

pos/cv006_15448.txt apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt visually , the film is very powerful . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt perhaps this last scene was the problem . 
pos/cv006_15448.txt it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .

pos/cv003_11664.txt  " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt dah-dum . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt  " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's " psycho , " and it never seems to age . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt  " it's your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , " and they are a threat . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt the shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt many have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . 
pos/cv003_11664.txt but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . 


pos/cv158_10390.txt

pos/cv158_10390.txt with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous " ellen " sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it's also noticeable that this " alternative lifestyle " becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , " and he's gay . " 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and " entertainment tonight " wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of " inside entertainment " , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt check this one out . 
pos/cv158_10390.txt you'll have a gay old time .

pos/cv177_10367.txt  " oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! " 
pos/cv177_10367.txt mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt  " didn't i sound just like a mother ? " 
pos/cv177_10367.txt  " you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt  " i know , but i still can't believe it . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? " 
pos/cv177_10367.txt marty , you see , is a grown-up twin . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level .

pos/cv177_10367.txt perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands .

pos/cv177_10367.txt jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt  " are we entertaining royalty ? " 
pos/cv177_10367.txt with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? 
pos/cv177_10367.txt the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . 
pos/cv177_10367.txt it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity .
