neg/cv044_18429.txt i'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt in _the wedding singer_ , she was julia gulia . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt in _never been kissed_ , she's josie grossie . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo-jo . . . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt aw forget it . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt i'll stick to my day job . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt this is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters aren't teens . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt the story she's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt she is to return to high school as a student and explain what's really going on . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt the irony is that drew's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt when she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the " i know the answer " in class that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt at least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc's leelee sobieski--watch for her ) , who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are " supposed " to be more beautiful than her . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt what works : drew's geeky old-self . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt after a start in films that was headline driven , and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character , it's a surprise to see her with bad hair , big glasses and braces . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt it's very funny . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt what doesn't work : drew's geeky new-self . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt come on . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt nobody dresses as bad as she does . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt couldn't she just go to _the gap_ and take suggestions ? 
neg/cv044_18429.txt had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt the comedy is supposed to progress when drew's younger brother ( played with zest by david arquette ) reenlists to jump-start his baseball career . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt now , how in the world can somebody as nerdy ( but in a funny way ) as he can be the most popular kid in the school . . . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt in a day ? ! 
neg/cv044_18429.txt the dialogue in the film is , well , an embarrassment . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt her co-workers ( molly shannon , john c . reilly and gary marshall ) are in terminal hyper-drive . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt her teenage peers ( except sobieski ) are so inept and stupid that there's little bite from them . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt couldn't the filmmakers watch _heathers_ first ? 
neg/cv044_18429.txt lastly , i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt if you see the film , you'd know what i'm talking about : 
neg/cv044_18429.txt drew walks into a bar , has her hand stamped , and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious , um , cake . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt she goes wild , sleeps in late . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt when she wakes , she rushes off to school , without showering , without noticing that her head , lying on her stamped hand all night , has transferred part of the stamp's image to her forehead , spelling " loser " . 
neg/cv044_18429.txt funny , eh ? 
neg/cv044_18429.txt  . . . except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords . 


neg/cv338_9183.txt

neg/cv338_9183.txt wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the " original " inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing 
neg/cv338_9183.txt for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt this is just as well . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt they're either silly , sappy , or both . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the dialog gets much of the credit for this . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , " well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . " 
neg/cv338_9183.txt not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , " this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . " 
neg/cv338_9183.txt my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt her response is , " they have weapons and technology . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt we just have love . " 
neg/cv338_9183.txt suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt which it does . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt please note that it is the action that is unexpected . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt that it is disappointing is not . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the film couldn't settle on a particular mood . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt so who doesn't know this already ? 
neg/cv338_9183.txt well , maybe children . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt it's not . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt so is the film for adults ? 
neg/cv338_9183.txt if so , we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? 
neg/cv338_9183.txt wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . 
neg/cv338_9183.txt however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit . 


neg/cv929_1841.txt

neg/cv929_1841.txt arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt review ====== 
neg/cv929_1841.txt well , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt however , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt this of course doesn't mean its bad . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ? 
neg/cv929_1841.txt arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt kevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which weren't very funny . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt couteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt  ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . ) 
neg/cv929_1841.txt so what is good about the movie ? 
neg/cv929_1841.txt well as i said there are a few amusing moments . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt gee , this is really short . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt not much to say about the film really . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt it is just kind of there . 
neg/cv929_1841.txt watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre . 


neg/cv698_16930.txt

neg/cv698_16930.txt well , here's a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt after just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? 
neg/cv698_16930.txt it is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt at least some smut would have livened things up a bit . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt  " porky's , " tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt  " porky's , " ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt one of the most offensive things about , " porky's , " is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt that sure is revealing information . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt for example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt mrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80's films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt any of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984's " sixteen candles , " or , 1985's " the breakfast club , " put , " porky's , " at an even greater shame . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt those films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt and heck , if , " porky's , " wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i'd take 1982's " fast times at ridgemont high , " or 1982's " the last american virgin , " over this any day of the week . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt director bob clark is not a bad director . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt two years after he made , " porky's , " he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , " a christmas story . " 
neg/cv698_16930.txt i would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay . 
neg/cv698_16930.txt just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , " porky's . " 


neg/cv375_9932.txt

neg/cv375_9932.txt you would think that this film's dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and " americanizing " it . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt you'd be wrong , since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson , robin driscoll , and richard curtis . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt should you ever happen to meet those chaps , do me a favor . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear , " what were you thinking ? ! 
neg/cv375_9932.txt have you ever heard the phrase 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' ? ! " 
neg/cv375_9932.txt then walk away . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt the film concerns mr . bean ( atkinson ) and his visit to america while escorting the painting of " whistler's mother " to an american buyer ( played by burt reynolds , in the type of bit part that his success in " boogie nights " should hopefully do away with ) . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt now how or why mr . bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can't even describe how the film explains it . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt the point is that mr . bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt problems problems problems , where to begin ? 
neg/cv375_9932.txt first , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from " beetlejuice " or one note away from the score from " rob roy " . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt then , the song choices are totally uninspired . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt  " good vibrations " ? 
neg/cv375_9932.txt  " i love l . a . " ? 
neg/cv375_9932.txt wow , don't put any thought into that guys . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt also , bean makes way too much noise in the film . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt the character doesn't speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt each episode was like a chaplin silent movie . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt in the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it's annoying , and just plain wrong for the character . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt the main problem though is that it's just not funny . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt multiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt sad , and creatively lazy . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt as a series , " mr . bean " only ran for about 13 episodes or so . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? 
neg/cv375_9932.txt 13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn't exhausted all possible situations . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it's almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn't for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt and even that isn't a very positive statement . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt please guys , go back to england and go back to television so you'll make me laugh again . 
neg/cv375_9932.txt [pg-13] 


neg/cv715_19246.txt

neg/cv715_19246.txt if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for " wild wild west , " the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt these treats are great relief from the summer heat . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt in this film , they are no where to be found . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt two men are asked to stop this threat . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt  " now touch my breast , " west says . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt gordon does so and then softly coos his approval . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ? 
neg/cv715_19246.txt it was as if the director was yelling " will smith , do your own thing . . . and 
neg/cv715_19246.txt action ! " 
neg/cv715_19246.txt here's an example . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt he must endear himself to the crowd to escape . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt the director yells , " will smith , do your own thing . . . and 
neg/cv715_19246.txt action ! " 
neg/cv715_19246.txt in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt  " will smith , do your own thing . . . and 
neg/cv715_19246.txt action ! " 
neg/cv715_19246.txt worse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt there's actually a lot of imagination at work in this film . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt and that's too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his 'thing , ' this film might have been palatable . 
neg/cv715_19246.txt as it turns out , " wild wild west " is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year . 


neg/cv441_15276.txt

neg/cv441_15276.txt years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt _brazil_ is on my personal top ten . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt _the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt _what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt big mistake . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it doesn't . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt hmm . . . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt  ( the " not meeting god " part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt read on . . . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt chris' wife commits suicide . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
neg/cv441_15276.txt good question . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and i like good thought-provoking questions . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt hey chris : did you forget ? 
neg/cv441_15276.txt your thoughts are _real_ . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
neg/cv441_15276.txt because there would be no movie , that+s why . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : " that+s fantasy . " 
neg/cv441_15276.txt umm . . . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt all due respect . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt another idea , based on " time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! " 
neg/cv441_15276.txt so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and forcing her to write " i still exist " in her diary , imo , is just too tacky . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt _gag me with a spoon_ . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt my vote goes to a rare cd called " never say die " ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt  ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt melancholic , yes . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt depressing , yes . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt but far more entertaining . . . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt suicide--bad . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt _don+t do it_ . 
neg/cv441_15276.txt no . no . no . ( got it ? --you 
neg/cv441_15276.txt shouldn+t have to pay $7 . 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest . )

neg/cv553_26965.txt  " have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? " 
neg/cv553_26965.txt obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released " urban legends : final cut " . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt this is another " scream " -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! 
neg/cv553_26965.txt a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? 
neg/cv553_26965.txt this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? 
neg/cv553_26965.txt it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt however , director john ottman manages to make " urban legends : final cut " into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in " scream " , ottman takes seriously . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt even movies like " lost in space " and " mission to mars " seem spectacular in its shadow . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt we have not seen such waste of t ! 
neg/cv553_26965.txt ime and resources since " showgirls " ( 1995 ) . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . 
neg/cv553_26965.txt let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend . 


neg/cv362_16985.txt

neg/cv362_16985.txt synopsis : back-up quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school , even though he'd rather read " slaughterhouse five " than the playbook . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt evil football coach kilmer throws away moxxon's book , though , while the evil team physician injects painkillers into the players . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt in the meantime , moxxon's kid brother forms a cult , and a bubblegum-blond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt comments : since i usually review horror and science fiction films , i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt  ( pun intended . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt thank you ! ) 
neg/cv362_16985.txt varsity blues was produced by mtv , and it really shows . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt the adults all have problems , of course , and , as one-dimensional characters , they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt yes , this movie represents high school life in mtv-land . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt this is a land where your health teacher is also a part-time stripper , your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck , your kid brother forms a " cute " cult , your football coach is an uncaring , obssessive madman , and your friends' lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt all you , as the main character , want to do , however , is read " slaughterhouse five " and attend brown university in the fall . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt well , at least this is a little more realistic than mtv's " the real world . " 
neg/cv362_16985.txt varsity blues stars james van der beek , this week's teen tv star making the leap to the big screen . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt he plays the hick moxxon adequately , though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt  ( " you dawn't own mah life ! " 
neg/cv362_16985.txt who would want to ? ) 
neg/cv362_16985.txt jon voight , the stock evil guy in countless other movies , is , surprise , the stock evil guy here . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt but is he really evil , or is he a product of society ? 
neg/cv362_16985.txt after all , everybody , young and old , in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt the film's screenplay never answers this burning question . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt at times , iliff's story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes , but , before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie , they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt the movie's pacing is slow , and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt i suppose i'm being a little hard on varsity blues . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt maybe i'm just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it , even though it was dollar night at the cinema . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more money . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt i found the film oftentimes ludicrous and boring . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt i wished i had thought of that . 
neg/cv362_16985.txt alcohol , lots of it , may have helped the viewing experience .

neg/cv999_14636.txt two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit " what is love ? " 
neg/cv999_14636.txt while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring " roxbury guys " sketch that would presumably make a good feature . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt emphasis on the word " presumably . " 
neg/cv999_14636.txt _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original " roxbury guys " skits . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt with " what is love ? " 
neg/cv999_14636.txt blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out " hotties " at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxbury guys " is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to " what is love ? " , 
neg/cv999_14636.txt bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all . 
neg/cv999_14636.txt after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .
