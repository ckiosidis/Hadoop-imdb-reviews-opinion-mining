neg/cv273_28961.txt a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . 
neg/cv273_28961.txt unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .

neg/cv448_16409.txt the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt in other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt 54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt the difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt he keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt the movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt he is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt he's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt myers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt the story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt shades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt eventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt his looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt shane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt 54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt it's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance . 
neg/cv448_16409.txt it's sort of like the musical era it covers . 


neg/cv937_9816.txt

neg/cv937_9816.txt take a look at the following equation . . . . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged 
neg/cv937_9816.txt yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt bill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) 
neg/cv937_9816.txt who , thankfully , dosen't say much . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt the script is horrendous . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt there's some impressive make up effects also . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt but great effects and make up don't make a great film . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . 
neg/cv937_9816.txt why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? 
neg/cv937_9816.txt overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague )

neg/cv595_26420.txt the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen " get carter " i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt  " get carter " falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt you might call them the " steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . " 
neg/cv595_26420.txt you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt he believes his brother ? richie was " taken out " and didn't die from a dwi accident . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his " rambo-on-testosterone-therapy " voice . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt i could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt i don't like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt yes , " get carter " is just that complicated and complex . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like " the usual suspects " for example - just the opposite . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't remember what had already happened and didn't figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn't a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt mel gibson starred in " payback " a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt so ultimately " get carter " fails for pretty much every selling point it has . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt the action sequences are not at all exciting or original . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible . 
neg/cv595_26420.txt  * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining . 


neg/cv733_9891.txt

neg/cv733_9891.txt contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt some of them aren't even good . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful " un indien dans la ville " ( presented as " little indian , big city , " and remade into that crap tim allen flick , " jungle2jungle " ) , and this . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt  " french twist " ( the " cool " american title , not the real one , which was " gazon maudit , " literally meaning " twisted ground , " or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! ) 
neg/cv733_9891.txt ending . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in " fargo " ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt the writing and directing is really the big problem with it . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt even woody allen's not-very-good " a midsummer night's sex comedy " is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt thank god for the fast forward button . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt the acting , however , isn't bad at all . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt but " french twist " is just pretty lame . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments . 
neg/cv733_9891.txt but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film .

neg/cv762_15604.txt

neg/cv762_15604.txt if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? 
neg/cv762_15604.txt if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? 
neg/cv762_15604.txt while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? 
neg/cv762_15604.txt -- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ? 
neg/cv762_15604.txt i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its " themes " are . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way " normal " people look at celebrities . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify , simon , is not a " normal " guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , " it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! " ) . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . 
neg/cv762_15604.txt i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider . 


neg/cv557_12237.txt

neg/cv557_12237.txt i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt sigourney weaver , whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now well just ignore it and move on . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? 
neg/cv557_12237.txt well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt they ( yawn ) were wrong . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt theres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film , do it well .  
neg/cv557_12237.txt i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt one exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man , what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt oh , and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . 
neg/cv557_12237.txt so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie 


neg/cv493_14135.txt

neg/cv493_14135.txt to sum the entire film " 54 " up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt  " 54 " , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio " 54 " . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co-owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt  . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt  . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt you expected more , didn't you . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt there isn't . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax ( isn't that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it's glamour . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt for much of its target audience , college age to early thirties , it attempts to show celebrities mixing with " normal people . " 
neg/cv493_14135.txt this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt you can be sure that half of the audience hasn't heard of them , another quarter only know their names , and the other quarter knew they were there already . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued , almost nostalgic performance , when needed . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on " coffee talk " sans dress and wig . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the supporting cast of salma hayek , breckin meyer , and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the romance between phillippe and cambell , as a soap opera star , is completely implausable . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt hayek's wanna-be singer seems extremely forced and her husband , greg ( meyer ) stands in as shane o'shae's surrogate best friend . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt overall , " 54 " tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt the film never leads to anything , has no obserable point , and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people . 
neg/cv493_14135.txt in truth , that reminded me of the eighies . 


neg/cv894_22140.txt

neg/cv894_22140.txt i'm giving this stinker . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt in mine , it's not . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt wrong mel ! 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt  ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) 
neg/cv894_22140.txt lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt it's just too funny . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? 
neg/cv894_22140.txt oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt but i digress . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt golly , will the hilarity just never end ? 
neg/cv894_22140.txt he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt together , they save the day from evil . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt not one person in this movie gives a decent performance . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt ok , he really didn't -- but he should have . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
neg/cv894_22140.txt mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .
