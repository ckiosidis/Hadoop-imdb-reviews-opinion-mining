neg/cv641_13412.txt abrams directed by michael bay 
neg/cv641_13412.txt it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt  ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) 
neg/cv641_13412.txt they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt why an oil driller ? 
neg/cv641_13412.txt they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt  ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
neg/cv641_13412.txt hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) 
neg/cv641_13412.txt harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt nor will you care . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt  " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
neg/cv641_13412.txt rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
neg/cv641_13412.txt his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt  ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) 
neg/cv641_13412.txt whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! " 
neg/cv641_13412.txt i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt it has a vivid soundmix . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt bollocks ! 
neg/cv641_13412.txt the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt remember a little film called jaws ? 
neg/cv641_13412.txt in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . 
neg/cv641_13412.txt and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

neg/cv616_29187.txt susan granger's review of " session 9 " ( usa films ) 
neg/cv616_29187.txt sometimes you just get more than your bargained for . . . like when boston-based hazmat elimination , run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant , david caruso , assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt erected in 1871 , deserted and decomposing since 1985 , the danvers mental hospital , is one of the most malevolent " locations " ever chosen for a film . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt the structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble-strewn corridors , collapsing floors , stagnant pools of water , isolation cells , and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre-frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt and each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon , brandon sexton iii , and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as , one by one , their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they're working . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt the film's title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't particularly scary . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . 
neg/cv616_29187.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " session 9 " is a dark , gloomy 4 . silly me . . . at 
neg/cv616_29187.txt first , i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers , the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock's truly terrifying " rebecca " that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley .

neg/cv383_14662.txt  " holy man " boasts a sweet , gentle , comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt unfortunately , to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set-up , loads of tedious filler , interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching , a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia's career . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt if ever a movie screamed " wait for video so you can fast-forward through all the dull and annoying parts , " this is it . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt eddie murphy plays g , a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt a chance meeting with ricky hayman ( goldblum ) , a stressed-out executive of a home-shopping channel , and kate newell ( kelly preston ) , a no-nonsense media analyst , results in physical injury to g . quicker than you can say " the odd couple , " g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt after some script gymnastics , g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network , wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations , enraging network owner mr . mcbainbridge ( loggia ) , and becoming a national media sensation . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt  " holy man " attempts to be several things at once . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt it tries to satirize home shopping networks , but it's difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self-parody . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts , but that's common knowledge already . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt  " holy man " also tries to present a story of redemption , as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g's good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt anyone want to place a wager on his final decision ? 
neg/cv383_14662.txt the one genuine asset in " holy man " is eddie murphy , who gives a charming performance , sharing love , good will and relevant advice to all those around him , while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he's onscreen . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt unfortunately , he's not onscreen enough . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt jeff goldblum gets the lion's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt as his potential love interest , kelly preston tries to brighten things up , but she transforms from an all-business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt the other principal actor , robert loggia , wastes his talents in a one-note turn as a ruthless , screaming monster . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt structurally unsound and way too long , " holy man " is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn't . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle , wait until it hits video and fast-forward past everything except the murphy scenes . 
neg/cv383_14662.txt g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that's the best way to do so .

neg/cv363_29273.txt susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros . ) 
neg/cv363_29273.txt thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt now , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt and an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt working from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography , luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " american outlaws " is a galloping , formulaic 3 . 
neg/cv363_29273.txt it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie . 


neg/cv659_21483.txt

neg/cv659_21483.txt i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt convinced despite his reservations that it's time to " sh * t or get off the pot , " jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . 
neg/cv659_21483.txt the bachelor is love among the mannequins . 


neg/cv345_9966.txt

neg/cv345_9966.txt movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt they spoke little , but fought a lot . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt thus , the movie was easy to digest . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt try reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt but the movie is not a complete fatality . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt even if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt but it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt  ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . 
neg/cv345_9966.txt rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . 


neg/cv936_17473.txt

neg/cv936_17473.txt starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt sure . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt william baldwin isn't a bad actor . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt if it was the latter , it worked . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? 
neg/cv936_17473.txt well , i'm glad you asked that question . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? 
neg/cv936_17473.txt by the end of the movie you won't care . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt the story is so contrived it isn't funny . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . 
neg/cv936_17473.txt unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .

neg/cv988_20168.txt this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be " one of the hottest writers in hollywood " . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) 
neg/cv988_20168.txt script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series " dawson's creek " . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said " sure , go for it ! " . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt uhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? 
neg/cv988_20168.txt plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs . tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! ) . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's " dawson's creek " , a show kevin created . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he was once an aspiring actor . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's " another world " . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book " killing mr . griffin " by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , 
neg/cv988_20168.txt lois duncan . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he has also come out and said that he is a gay man . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt this film was originally titled killing mrs . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called " wasteland " . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt this is actor barry watson first full feature film . 
neg/cv988_20168.txt he has played the character of " seth " on tv's " malibu shores " several times .

neg/cv747_18189.txt in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt which wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt of course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt for them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt which , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt salon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt in 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt screenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt caught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt she informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt but , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt unfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . 
neg/cv747_18189.txt all in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . 


neg/cv336_10363.txt

neg/cv336_10363.txt an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt it would be kind to call him bland . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt on the technical side , it's all bad news . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt repeated use is made of the " werewolf cam " , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt  ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a " bad movie " sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction . 
neg/cv336_10363.txt ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either .
