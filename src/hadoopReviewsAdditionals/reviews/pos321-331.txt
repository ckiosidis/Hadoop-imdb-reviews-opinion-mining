pos/cv776_20529.txt dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt to boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt movies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt alex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt at times it moves beyond film into artwork . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt it is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt they are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt during this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt i don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt it ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt murdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt shadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt we see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt a great entrance . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt however , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt the city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt blade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt it is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt other science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt we ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt dark city is not so easily explained away . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt as the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt where is reality ? 
pos/cv776_20529.txt dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt perhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . 
pos/cv776_20529.txt anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it .

pos/cv026_29325.txt for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt the excitement starts before the music even begins . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " 
pos/cv026_29325.txt you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . 
pos/cv026_29325.txt instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

pos/cv868_11948.txt city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt seth wants to become human so he can feel her . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , " former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . " 
pos/cv868_11948.txt  ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) 
pos/cv868_11948.txt messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the acting is superb from everyone involved . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt he's quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt he's perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt his direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . 
pos/cv868_11948.txt it's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .

pos/cv933_23776.txt

pos/cv933_23776.txt this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt this is the best we've seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody's roundup . " 
pos/cv933_23776.txt if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt a real effort is made in the technical department . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year . 
pos/cv933_23776.txt i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .

pos/cv196_29027.txt jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt  ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . ) 
pos/cv196_29027.txt in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , " action ! " 
pos/cv196_29027.txt best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was " stupid " enough to buy tickets to this movie . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt  ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . ) 
pos/cv196_29027.txt the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt guilty . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt no , wait . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt forget , `thus far . ' 
pos/cv196_29027.txt it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . 
pos/cv196_29027.txt the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 .

pos/cv255_13683.txt it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt indeed . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt henry fool ( " used to have an ? e' " ) arrives at garbageman simon grim's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been " exiled and marginalized " by the publishing community because of his criminal activity . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt simon's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its " pornographic " content . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt meanwhile , henry seduces both simon's dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt henry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from " udderley's " ; the big teen hang-out is called " world of donuts " ; simon wears his garbageman's uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt  ( which is key to the conclusion's said ambiguity ) . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously " quirky " ; the introductory scenes are a chore . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren't pop slackers . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt  ( shades of film school . . . ) 
pos/cv255_13683.txt the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . 
pos/cv255_13683.txt this , hartley's seventh feature , is contemplative about " the artist " ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon's work , and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers' pens . 


pos/cv643_29349.txt

pos/cv643_29349.txt in `enemy at the gates' , jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt it's world war ii , and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt law's vassili is the russian's top pawn to victory . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt lots of war stuff happens . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt an older , german version of jude's character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt he's equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt they constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov 
pos/cv643_29349.txt the set-up is decent , and so are the production values . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt boasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt the actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan' . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt either their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt with dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt that said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i don't think ed harris was really trying . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt while the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt director jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not going to die , it's relatively pointless . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt we get that he's talented , okay , let's move on . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt that's the problem with `enemy at the gates' ; it just doesn't know when to stop . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt reestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film , jude law carries the movie . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt without him , this costly production would have gone into the ground . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt the story and acting are of good quality , but there's never a sense of authenticity or reality . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt something about this war movie is undeniably modern , and it loses its feeling . 
pos/cv643_29349.txt strange enough , the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper . 


pos/cv136_11505.txt

pos/cv136_11505.txt the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a " pageant " , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt  ( a heist comedy ? 
pos/cv136_11505.txt yup . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt deniro and hoffman are " stealing " the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) 
pos/cv136_11505.txt wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt ok , maybe it's not " love thy neighbor as thyself " or even " two plus two makes four " , but a truth nonetheless . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt  ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) 
pos/cv136_11505.txt and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt it's all : " what do i love ? 
pos/cv136_11505.txt what is it that brings me joy ? 
pos/cv136_11505.txt baseball , " minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the " fad king " , who handles the profitable " back-end " -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious " ballad of the green berets " parody . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated " hero " of the albanian conflict . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt  ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) 
pos/cv136_11505.txt wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . 
pos/cv136_11505.txt wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't .
