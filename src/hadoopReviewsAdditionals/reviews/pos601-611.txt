pos/cv970_18450.txt synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt there is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt within the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a " phantom " menace . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt jedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala's home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt on the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt the five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt can they free amidala's helpless planet ? 
pos/cv970_18450.txt opinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace's greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? 
pos/cv970_18450.txt director george lucas answers , " it's only a movie . " 
pos/cv970_18450.txt to me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt visually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt it is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt at least this much is clear : there's plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it's good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt weaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt this dilutes the central story . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt additionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt better ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt strengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt the film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt bottom line ? 
pos/cv970_18450.txt seeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . 
pos/cv970_18450.txt we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months .

pos/cv412_24095.txt frequency n . , 
pos/cv412_24095.txt the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc 
pos/cv412_24095.txt don't worry . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt when watching the thriller frequency , you won't have to know what the heck frequency means . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt the premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt a new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn't supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john's mother and nine other women . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt  ( i told you that wasn't confusing ? ) . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt overall , i was very pleased with frequency . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt it's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt i usually don't buy those cheesy " i love you dad " segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ? 
pos/cv412_24095.txt what would i do ? 
pos/cv412_24095.txt would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ? 
pos/cv412_24095.txt or stop some kids from shooting other kids ? 
pos/cv412_24095.txt or buy stock from yahoo ! ? 
pos/cv412_24095.txt  ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences ) . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt both share that " change the past slightly , and you'll change the future heavily " warning . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt the changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt both are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt there are some problems with the film though . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt first , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt another problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt while in the film , which is not enough , the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you , like it almost did for me , check this movie out . 
pos/cv412_24095.txt you may be surprised as well . 


pos/cv751_15719.txt

pos/cv751_15719.txt life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? 
pos/cv751_15719.txt what do you think ? 
pos/cv751_15719.txt however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's " triumph of the underdog " spirit . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . 
pos/cv751_15719.txt it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year . 


pos/cv768_11751.txt

pos/cv768_11751.txt every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? 
pos/cv768_11751.txt of course . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? 
pos/cv768_11751.txt usually , yes . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? 
pos/cv768_11751.txt not very likely . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school 
pos/cv768_11751.txt girls . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt which leads me to the really good part of the review . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . 
pos/cv768_11751.txt despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . 


pos/cv344_5312.txt

pos/cv344_5312.txt do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ? 
pos/cv344_5312.txt do you ? 
pos/cv344_5312.txt well , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt unfortunately , there's a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo's character abby relates to it well . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman . . . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt uma being the only woman's name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt as abby tells her , " you burp and they think it's cute . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt you barf and they line up to hold your hair back . " 
pos/cv344_5312.txt but nora's down on herself for being too shallow and superficial . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby's talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt  ( oh come on , any idiot knows how to handle that problem ! ) 
pos/cv344_5312.txt he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt abby , though , knows her body doesn't match her personality and that she probably won't have a chance with him once he sees her . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt so she gives him nora's body description and stands him up . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun , abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful , she's not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person , but he doesn't suspect anything , realizing he's not living in a " three's company " episode . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt the charade continues , with abby furthering the relationship over the phone ( including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex/masturbation sequence ) and nora furthering it in person , while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt like sleepless in seattle , this comedy/romance is predictable all the way through , but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt the truth about cats and dogs isn't quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be , but it handles well a theme i could identify with . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt the thing is , i find janeane garafolo rather attractive . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt she's no uma but i'm sure in real life she'd have no problems attracting men . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt i , on the other hand , couldn't attract a man to save my life . . . 
pos/cv344_5312.txt and am rather proud of that fact . 


pos/cv057_7453.txt

pos/cv057_7453.txt i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano 
pos/cv057_7453.txt volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt there is one small quake then another quake . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall .

pos/cv057_7453.txt i was still good none the less . 
pos/cv057_7453.txt it had excellent special effects .

pos/cv709_10529.txt

pos/cv709_10529.txt some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt i finished mike figgis' " leaving las vegas " hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt alot of people refer to this film as " that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude " . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt  " leaving las vegas " is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a " friend " of his to mooch some money off of . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says " i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again . " 
pos/cv709_10529.txt now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since " adventures in babysitting " ) named sera . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt they are both very lonely , self-destructive people . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt and it isn't even a sexual relationship . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt they don't even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt  " leaving las vegas " is not a film about plot . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn't too much of a story to it . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt it is more a film about people and how they react to one another . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt but don't go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from " leaving las vegas " . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that's right ) . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don't see it . 
pos/cv709_10529.txt however , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have .

pos/cv502_10406.txt [warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner .

pos/cv502_10406.txt due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt although this is the future , it looks like a western . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the " clan " 
pos/cv502_10406.txt after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the " restored congress of the united states of america " . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt it's derivitive of costner's own " waterworld " and clint eastwood westerns . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the film is often down-right corny . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt despite the film's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt what was the war about ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt how did civilization change so rapidly ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt everyone has horses : where did all they come from ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the " law of eights " that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt the evil army is called " holnists " which sounds coincidentally like the new age " holism " , but why ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt why is the general named " bethlehem " ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt there seems to be some reason for that , but what ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt sometimes the movie feels like a joke . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt an army of postal workers armed with guns ? 
pos/cv502_10406.txt considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt it's doubtful that " the postman " is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt  ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the " michael redman " arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . 
pos/cv502_10406.txt perhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner's postal service . )

pos/cv796_15782.txt after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt as the film warns us at the beginning , it's not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the only thing missing is charlton heston . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren . ) 
pos/cv796_15782.txt we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn't really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt he soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer . ) 
pos/cv796_15782.txt rameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt gone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt but , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt jeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt he's included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt it's a remarkable achievement . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt also remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost 'slap dash' effort , to shame . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt relying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the film seems a little caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and 'moving' shots , but they _do_ look incredible . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the final 'plague' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt kudos to the animators . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the vocal talent is also very good . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt val kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn't sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing . ) 
pos/cv796_15782.txt sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great , and steve martin and martin short are very good , but not in the film long enough . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt finally , michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt kudos also goes to the voice of god , who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt sadly , he is uncredited , and i couldn't quite work out who the voice was . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt  ( but e-mail if you do . ) 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the songs are good , ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt they don't disturb the movie , and while not particularly memorable , they are nice to listen to ( they're well sung aswell . ) 
pos/cv796_15782.txt the musical score is suitably epic , with some beautiful tunes . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt coupled with the superb visuals , the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat , backed up with a great story . 
pos/cv796_15782.txt entertaining both for kids and adults , this film is a must see .

pos/cv339_21119.txt

pos/cv339_21119.txt voices . . . . . trey parker , matt stone , george clooney , minnie driver . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt  " south park : bigger , longer and uncut " is undoubtedly crude , offensive , mean-spirited movie , that comes off as a politcally correct movie too . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt if your canadian , a strong christian , fat , gay or anything else , you will be offended . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt but when you watch this movie , there is no doubt that you will laugh . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show , south park stars cartman , an overweight , foul-mouthed kid , with attitude , and a sweet side . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt kenny , a poor kid who gets killed in every episode , and talks with his coat hood covering his head . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt stan a regular , sometimes boring kid who has problems with women . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt the movie opens with a funny , but messageable song , that all of the people of south park sing . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt cartman , stan , kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip ( beavis and butthead types ) movie " asses of fire " . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets , they learn the movie is rated r , which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt the kids do not understand this , and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt while in the movie , laughing at the movie , terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt they kids then go out and cuss themselves , getting in trouble and causing kyle's mom to go against the mpaa . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt while doing this kenny learns a thing or to , by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt kenny does so , dies , and goes to hell , to find out that satan and saddam huiessan ( homosexual lovers ) , are about to take over the world , if terrance and phillip die . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt >from here on , nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt but believe me , this isn't your regular south park tv show , and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt this film contains extreme profanity ( over 130 " f " words and a collection of others ) . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way , south park : bigger , longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt but i bet you will not leave the movie , for at least laughing one time or more . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt and enjoying yourself . 
pos/cv339_21119.txt take it from me , south park : b , l , and u , isn't as good as you'd hope , but it is good for some laughs .
