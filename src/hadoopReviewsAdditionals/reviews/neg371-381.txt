neg/cv905_28965.txt in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , " boogie nights " ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the " planet of the apes . " 
neg/cv905_28965.txt maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr . ( " cast away " ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( " mighty joe young " ) . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , " duets " ) . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt ari ( helena bonham carter , " fight club " ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , " titanic " ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual . ' 
neg/cv905_28965.txt general thade ( tim roth , " lucky numbers " ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt he's sweet on ari . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , " driven " ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt the only real success of the 2001 " planet of the apes " is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt the ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt the apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , " sleepy hollow " ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's " dracula . " 
neg/cv905_28965.txt that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman's tribal , percussive score . 
neg/cv905_28965.txt  " planet of the apes " was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that's going to the dogs .

neg/cv849_17215.txt ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt but no one has arrived yet . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt those who are invited are the ones that have the issues . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt but it didn't happen that way . 
neg/cv849_17215.txt the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .

neg/cv960_28877.txt dr . alan grant ( sam neill , " jurassic park " ) is becoming disillusioned . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt when the kirbys ( william h . macy , " fargo " ; tea leoni , " the family man " ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of " the lost world " ) he's disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt however the kirbys haven't given dr . grant their real agenda in " jurassic park iii . " 
neg/cv960_28877.txt of course , we , the audience , have been tipped off , given that the film begins by showing us eric ( trevor morgan , " the patriot " ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , " election " ) going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry ( and looks like cheesy rear projection ) . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt grant's established back home with a new right hand man , billy brennan ( alessandro nivola , " love's labour's lost " ) on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt he also pays a visit to old flame dr . ellie sattler ( laura dern , " jurassic park " ) , now married to another with a young son who calls grant 'the dinosaur man' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film's poorly imagined finale . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip , which is really an illegal gambit to save their son , that young paraglider . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt the couple aren't millionaires , making grant's check bogus , and they're separated as well ( eric was with amanda's new boyfriend , not that that makes much sense ) , meaning we're in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt the kirbys hired hands ( and obvious bait ) are a threesome led by mr . udesky ( michael jeter , " the gift " ) . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt  ( didn't anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h . macy together and not having them be related was a little odd ? ) 
neg/cv960_28877.txt as directed by joe johnston ( " october sky , " " jumanji " ) ( spielberg only produced this one ) from a risible script by peter buchman and the " election " team of alexander payne & jim taylor , " jurassic park iii " is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos ( a spinosauraus , which goes head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodons ) . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt the plot , as it were , is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt the effects are no longer new , and , as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson , rather murky looking at times . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt film editing by robert dalva ( " october sky " ) was presumably done by machete , to keep this down to a 90 minute run time . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt i know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors , then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt 'original' music by don davis just repeats john williams' original themes . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings , the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional . 
neg/cv960_28877.txt  " jurassic park iii " will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect , the same crowd who maybe liked " the lost world : jurassic park . "

neg/cv672_27988.txt  " saving silverman " is a good example of a good comedy gone bad . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt as a love story it is good , however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and 
neg/cv672_27988.txt those were just chuckles at the most ! 
neg/cv672_27988.txt the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j . d . mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt while in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt wayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it's up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt the performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt jason biggs right off the flop " loser " does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he's better at singing than acting ) . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt anyway the performances in the film are good , but it's too bad the script isn't . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt speaking of script , hank nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt the trailer for the movie , as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie , especially the funniest parts . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt somewhere " saving silverman " was meant to be a good movie , and it could have been , but alas in the end it wasn't . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt dennis dugan's direction is all right , he adds a few directorial touches here and there , nothing special being a simple comedy . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt  " saving silverman " is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one . 
neg/cv672_27988.txt it has a great cast , a good director and a sweet story . . . it's 
neg/cv672_27988.txt just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie . 


neg/cv320_9693.txt

neg/cv320_9693.txt this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt but the idea of doing a movie is insane . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt yet it still fails . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the acting is ok . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt this seems to be more of a visual film . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt however the film drags and is no fun . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . : 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the movie . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt you could do worse . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt but you could definitely do better . . .

neg/cv320_9693.txt street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme 
neg/cv320_9693.txt this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt it is more like a " movie " than it should be . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt yes , it's watchable . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt does it work ? 
neg/cv320_9693.txt sort of . . . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt in a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt it catches your attention . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like " there's chun li ! ! " 
neg/cv320_9693.txt or " look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega " . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no further . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt this movie needed more action in the first place . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt if you like light-hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia's last performance , or if you can't get enough of van damme . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt other than that , you could find better action flicks . 
neg/cv320_9693.txt  . 


neg/cv810_13660.txt

neg/cv810_13660.txt i admit it . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt and you know they'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa's elves . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt he later decks a reindeer . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt hey , man , why don't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you're at it ? 
neg/cv810_13660.txt jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? 
neg/cv810_13660.txt arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt he races from the office to his son's karate game , only to find out he missed it . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt and his kid distrusts him because he's never around . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt  ( gee , we haven't seen that in a movie before . ) 
neg/cv810_13660.txt arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt let me back up for a minute here -- arnold's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin' turboman sheets . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt i'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don't recognize him until the last minute . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( " your cookies are incredible " ) , it's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . 
neg/cv810_13660.txt maybe that's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .

neg/cv147_22625.txt our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot at a future title fight . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt the film is divided into two sections . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's " sassy grassy " green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .

neg/cv147_22625.txt both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .

neg/cv147_22625.txt this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . 
neg/cv147_22625.txt as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time .

neg/cv455_28866.txt violence is bad . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt violence is ugly . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt violence breeds yet more violence . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt kids , don't try this at home . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt  ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . ) 
neg/cv455_28866.txt if you piss a " family " member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt though slow moving , brother does have good elements . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily . 
neg/cv455_28866.txt it's a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up .

neg/cv736_24947.txt  " battlefield earth " is the best comedy of the year . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt it has to be . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much " battlefield earth " has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt is it as bad as advertised ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt oh yes , very much so . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the plot is incomprehensible . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the acting is atrocious . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the special effects are mediocre . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the action is dull . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the implausibilities are legion . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the dialogue is cringe-inducing . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the premise is basically a rip-off of " planet of the apes , " only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt  . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt  . ) 
neg/cv736_24947.txt so the " man-animal " can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt of course , his plan doesn't work . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt early previews for " battlefield earth , " with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , " what the hell is travolta thinking ? " 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the movie did nothing to stem such remarks . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt  ( " you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! 
neg/cv736_24947.txt fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! " ) 
neg/cv736_24947.txt it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt  ( he uses the word " leverage " like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) 
neg/cv736_24947.txt not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt  ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) 
neg/cv736_24947.txt he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt no wonder this guy never got his promotion . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in " battlefield earth . " 
neg/cv736_24947.txt bring a scorecard to track the plot holes . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt director roger christian shoots " battlefield earth " in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt are these things really so hard to construct ? 
neg/cv736_24947.txt my respect for supposed " lightweight " action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in " battlefield earth " how badly an action sequence can be shot . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt this movie is an absolute headache . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt for most of " battlefield earth's " running time , i just didn't know what was happening . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt here's how much of a disaster this is : " battlefield earth " is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt in fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . 
neg/cv736_24947.txt that'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again .

neg/cv488_21453.txt arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' 
neg/cv488_21453.txt a lot , and mike giggling like a loony . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt i suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . 
neg/cv488_21453.txt it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com 
neg/cv488_21453.txt  ) is better than the film .
