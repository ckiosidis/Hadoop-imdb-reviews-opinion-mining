neg/cv753_11812.txt bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest " unbreakable " code , mercury . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt and that's where art jeffries comes in . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i 
neg/cv753_11812.txt mean , who would know ? 
neg/cv753_11812.txt it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
neg/cv753_11812.txt he's already proven that mercury can be broken . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but 
neg/cv753_11812.txt i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then 
neg/cv753_11812.txt mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) 
neg/cv753_11812.txt willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt this film wasn't well thought out at all . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . 
neg/cv753_11812.txt mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer .

neg/cv598_18184.txt every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt but , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt two of them are assigned to cover the train collision . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt as soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt movie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt however , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . 
neg/cv598_18184.txt i'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though .

neg/cv305_9937.txt walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt some may say - so what ? 
neg/cv305_9937.txt it's just a kid's movie . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt well . . . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt consider yourselves warned . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt was this rushed to market to combat disney ? 
neg/cv305_9937.txt the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe . 
neg/cv305_9937.txt you'll see 60% of anastasia there .

neg/cv233_17614.txt at times , you'd think edtv would be an entertaining film . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? 
neg/cv233_17614.txt but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone's problems and settle his own . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt mcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt he overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed's step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt jenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i . e . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt can't hardly wait , and krippendorf's tribe . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt woody harrelson , as ed's brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , " my brother pissed on me . " ) 
neg/cv233_17614.txt elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed's biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner's opinion . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt i hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt edtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt extracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother's girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt i got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out . 
neg/cv233_17614.txt the only reason it doesn't drop below a " c " grade is because of the fine supporting performances .

neg/cv178_14380.txt starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz 
neg/cv178_14380.txt permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt  ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) 
neg/cv178_14380.txt ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for " alf " : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt insert proverbial downward spiral here . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! 
neg/cv178_14380.txt watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! 
neg/cv178_14380.txt stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt but permanent midnight is mostly soulless . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? 
neg/cv178_14380.txt and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? 
neg/cv178_14380.txt in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt  ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt is this hollywood . . . california ? ) 
neg/cv178_14380.txt i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt so much for the moral of that story . 
neg/cv178_14380.txt temporary midnight is more like it .

neg/cv972_26837.txt

neg/cv972_26837.txt 'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt chris columbus , the director who gave you " mrs . doubtfire " , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt andrew is interested in art and music , he " enjoys " making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt it shows out that because of a small failure in the " electrical circuits " and " positronic brain " andrew has accidentally gained a soul . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt this makes him unique and his evil creators worried . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt then mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt what makes us human ? 
neg/cv972_26837.txt the thoughts ? 
neg/cv972_26837.txt the emotions ? 
neg/cv972_26837.txt is it possible to become human ? 
neg/cv972_26837.txt at what point can we say to a robot " now you are one of us " ? 
neg/cv972_26837.txt these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question " when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? " , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt further more , there are other annoying problems . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt columbus is the first to have crossed that line . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt the world is simply frozen in time . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt i am not saying that everything should change . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt i suppose it's possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it's really hard . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt as always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt but it doesn't really matter . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt pretty much like last year's " meet joe black " , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn't deserve . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt when isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt everything seemed possible . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt now is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's " 20 000 leagues under the sea " , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality . 
neg/cv972_26837.txt let us hope that next year's " a . i . " 
neg/cv972_26837.txt will be more rewarding .

neg/cv673_25874.txt one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick " gone is sixty seconds , " one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of " gone in sixty seconds " is relatively weak and dull . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt randall " memphis " raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt watching " gone , " i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for " eleanor , " a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt i had high hopes for " gone " because it is director dominic sena's second film . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt  " kalifornia , " his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt in " gone " he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn't mesh with this plot . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt  " gone " either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt it's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt the weak script is a waste of a talented cast . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt in a " newsweek " interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( " leaving las vegas , " " bringing out the dead " ) , there are two major stinkers ( " snake eyes , " " con air , " " 8mm , " " city of angels " ) . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent . 
neg/cv673_25874.txt it's a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like " gone in 60 seconds . "

neg/cv125_9636.txt this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . " 
neg/cv125_9636.txt but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt  " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with " switchback . " 
neg/cv125_9636.txt for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? 
neg/cv125_9636.txt and dennis quaid ? 
neg/cv125_9636.txt  ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) 
neg/cv125_9636.txt ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . 
neg/cv125_9636.txt still , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold . 


neg/cv153_11607.txt

neg/cv153_11607.txt tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt however , they won't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he's always pursued : a real blonde . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara's perfume ads : " depression - it's not just a state of mind " . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt and , unfortunately , the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt keener's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt the movie's running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it . 
neg/cv153_11607.txt there's just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama . 


neg/cv823_17055.txt

neg/cv823_17055.txt starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt fast forward to the late '80's . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt unlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt anyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt not really , but that is how it seems . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt as i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt sadly , it doesn't work very well . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . 
neg/cv823_17055.txt  ( although that isn't so hot either . ) 
neg/cv823_17055.txt this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities .
