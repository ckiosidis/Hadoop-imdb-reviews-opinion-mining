pos/cv551_10565.txt after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt remember , the robot ? 
pos/cv551_10565.txt it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . " 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . " 
pos/cv551_10565.txt upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt  " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . " 
pos/cv551_10565.txt this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt  " mate with her ! " 
pos/cv551_10565.txt spencer exclaims . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt  " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . " 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the show has many funny twists . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? 
pos/cv551_10565.txt cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt oh , and eating is pretty funny too . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt star kid runs 1 : 41 . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt it is rated pg for fantasy combat . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * . 
pos/cv551_10565.txt when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully .

pos/cv372_6552.txt if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . 
pos/cv372_6552.txt the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good . 
pos/cv372_6552.txt you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . 
pos/cv372_6552.txt often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !

pos/cv355_16413.txt to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . 
pos/cv355_16413.txt committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 


pos/cv367_22792.txt

pos/cv367_22792.txt  " the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it's all work and no play with him . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt unfortunately the two break up . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt while this may sound straight forward it's not . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt what's so moving about it you ask ? 
pos/cv367_22792.txt the tragedy of it all . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt it just never did anything for me , until now . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . 
pos/cv367_22792.txt not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . 


pos/cv674_10732.txt

pos/cv674_10732.txt look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt >from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
pos/cv674_10732.txt film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : " [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . " 
pos/cv674_10732.txt while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt the " road not taken " approach isn't just a plot device , either . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , " being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . " 
pos/cv674_10732.txt but it's not all in the dialogue . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . 
pos/cv674_10732.txt for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . 


pos/cv357_13156.txt

pos/cv357_13156.txt  " if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . " 
pos/cv357_13156.txt starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus 
pos/cv357_13156.txt in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt i say " surprisingly " because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt and there are ways in which it does . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt she adeptly blends them all together . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt  " don't stray from the path , " rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential . 
pos/cv357_13156.txt and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version . 


pos/cv863_7424.txt

pos/cv863_7424.txt not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt all that is missing is a discussion of god . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any " style " at all . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt there are a few missteps . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt needless to say , it is also very depressing at times . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt but for many of us , of course , so is life . 
pos/cv863_7424.txt and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .

pos/cv811_21386.txt note : ordinarily , moviereviews . org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as " spoilers . " 
pos/cv811_21386.txt however , being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews . org 
pos/cv811_21386.txt feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations , plot giveaways will appear in the following review . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt if this bothers you , please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt  " what does it take to play carnegie hall ? 
pos/cv811_21386.txt practice . " 
pos/cv811_21386.txt it takes two hours for music of the heart to " play carnegie hall , " both figuratively and literally . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt that is the pattern-like plot of this production . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt also lacking depth is the film's " bad guy , " a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because " my mom said . . . " ) and a glowing concert . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt but they don't . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic " but . . . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt last night . . . " 
pos/cv811_21386.txt and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt one thing the film does lack is subtlety . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the fact that a little boy was playing " we shall overcome " on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt  ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) 
pos/cv811_21386.txt even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? 
pos/cv811_21386.txt he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . 
pos/cv811_21386.txt perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale . 


pos/cv267_14952.txt

pos/cv267_14952.txt while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt words " croatia " and " croatians " were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the " normal " way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt although the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt luckily , the dogs of war had a good script . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . 
pos/cv267_14952.txt but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . 


pos/cv322_20318.txt

pos/cv322_20318.txt now , lets first look into the history of shark films . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt there was the unforgettable jaws . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt now , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones ! 
pos/cv322_20318.txt russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt so-so acting , expected in most of your average action film . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt jackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt ll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt it does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour ! 
pos/cv322_20318.txt its like jurassic park under water . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt nothing too stressful , pure entertainment . 
pos/cv322_20318.txt renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) .
