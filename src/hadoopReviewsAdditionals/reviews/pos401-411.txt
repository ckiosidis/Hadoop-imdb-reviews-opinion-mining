pos/cv597_26360.txt --- brad " asshole " majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt and immediately tanked at the box office . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt it goes without saying that the " time warp " is the most popular song in the film . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt my personal favorite is " over at the frankenstein place " , but " dammit janet " is also maddeningly catchy . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune " sweet transvestite " need to be heard to be believed . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( " rose tint my world " , " don't dream it " , " wild and untamed thing " , and " i'm going home " ) , all of which are immensely singable . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt 25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called " superheroes " . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the " behind the music : rocky horror " special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung " hot patootie " . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt the " behind the music " segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt one of which is just the " superheroes " number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called " once in a while " . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is " a different sort of jaws " ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for " toucha toucha touch me " and " sweet transvestite " ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( " you're lucky . . . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt i'm lucky . . . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt he's lucky . . . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt we're all lucky ! " ) . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . 
pos/cv597_26360.txt i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

pos/cv370_5221.txt

pos/cv370_5221.txt i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt  " the celluloid closet " is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt but , that's the movie . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt now back to the preview . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone " boning " someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv ) . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt hmmmmm . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from " the handbook " that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain " no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . " 
pos/cv370_5221.txt hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt bravely , i pursued . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt  " i've seen that trailer , oh . . . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt probably half a dozen times , " i gulped . . . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt  " and i don't remember that scene . " 
pos/cv370_5221.txt  " well , " she chirped . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt  " it's there . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt our little eyes are trained to see that . " 
pos/cv370_5221.txt no really . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt in the words of dave barry , " i am not making this up . " 
pos/cv370_5221.txt they are " trained " to " see that ? " 
pos/cv370_5221.txt when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? 
pos/cv370_5221.txt gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or " the handbook " . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt and the light ain't good in there . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt but , having seen " the celluloid closet , " and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt a point well made in this candid and honest film . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain " no homosexuality or lesbianism " and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt let the ratings reflect not subject content , like " sex " and " violence " . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt let them reflect attitude content . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt in the future , i'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped . 
pos/cv370_5221.txt then i'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time . 


pos/cv251_22636.txt

pos/cv251_22636.txt the film " magnolia " can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt  " magnolia " is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of " boogie nights " fame . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make " magnolia " memorable . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of " magnolia's " scenes drag on too long . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt the performances in " magnolia " are perfection . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt  " magnolia " uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . 
pos/cv251_22636.txt i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .

pos/cv538_28667.txt the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , " snatch . " 
pos/cv538_28667.txt  " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt with " snatch , " the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt >from the very beginning , " snatch " tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug " the head " ( mike reid ) . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris " the blade " ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , " bullet tooth " tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt guy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives " snatch " an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt when he refuses sugar in his tea because " i'm sweet enough , " it makes you shiver , even as you laugh . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt there is a patent feel to the look of " snatch " and " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " that reeks of " signature " for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt nonetheless , " snatch " is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot . 
pos/cv538_28667.txt i give it a b+ .

pos/cv733_9839.txt i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt horner's has a steady " family " of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . 's hardcore film scene . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt boogie nights is not about sex . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her " babies " provides some of the films most poignant scenes . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name " dirk diggler " , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt i say " former " pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt this is bold and brave territory for such a young man . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt he pulls it off marvelously . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt wahlberg is a " big , bright star " with a big bright future . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt its intimate studies of character make it the superior film . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt wahlberg's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson's . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . 
pos/cv733_9839.txt still , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya 
pos/cv733_9839.txt know , kinda like disco . 


pos/cv033_24444.txt

pos/cv033_24444.txt in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt tobey maguire fits well in the role . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt this is a plot line i had trouble with . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt there is a movie in there somewhere . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt okay , maybe not so chivalrous . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , " she was a junkie for the printed word . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice " . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt i wish wonder boys had more of him . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt i'm privy to films about literary types i . e . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . 
pos/cv033_24444.txt many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . 


pos/cv133_16336.txt

pos/cv133_16336.txt it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt it is filled with above-the-title stars . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the cast , for the most part , gives great performances . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt terrence malick is a cinematic legend . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt he has often been called " the j . d . salinger of cinema . " 
pos/cv133_16336.txt his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt this film marks his return . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as " i'm scared . " 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt i'm not declaring that the film has no structure . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt ultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . 
pos/cv133_16336.txt after seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again .

pos/cv008_29435.txt after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .

pos/cv008_29435.txt 'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . 
pos/cv008_29435.txt  " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .

pos/cv060_10844.txt after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt  " you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , " he says , " then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' " 
pos/cv060_10844.txt of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt then she falls over , dead . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , " keep eating ! 
pos/cv060_10844.txt this is the last meal your mother ever made ! " 
pos/cv060_10844.txt crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the " good guys " come together for the final showdown . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . 
pos/cv060_10844.txt it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .

pos/cv665_29538.txt capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt the idea is something about ghosts and the internet . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt the film has an amazing apocalyptic style . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt  , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv665_29538.txt perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 
pos/cv665_29538.txt filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt his films all seem to have one style , bleak . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt cure is probably his classic . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt pulse is kurosawa back on form . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt but they are not entirely dead . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing " like a computer disk . " 
pos/cv665_29538.txt instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . 
pos/cv665_29538.txt i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
