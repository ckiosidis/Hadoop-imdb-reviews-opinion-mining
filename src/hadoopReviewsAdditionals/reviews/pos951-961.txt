pos/cv103_11021.txt i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt but i don't care . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt not even a little . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt 2 ) drew barrymore is great . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt 3 ) the movie is so funny . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt oh sure , it's trite . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt naturally , the true star here is sandler . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt i think the guy is flat-out hilarious . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt and the movie is just so funny . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt the film is predicable , but who cares ? 
pos/cv103_11021.txt the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt i just want everyone to know that i laughed . 
pos/cv103_11021.txt a lot .

pos/cv068_13400.txt

pos/cv068_13400.txt hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt i mean , come on . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? 
pos/cv068_13400.txt hell no . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt and that is exactly what this film is ; art . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt let me backtrack a minute . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt when i say " intellectual ground " , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt this is a thinking man's slasher flick . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt the " nosferatu " of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not 
pos/cv068_13400.txt really a good sign . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt he then discovers through some reading that the count is a " nosferatu " , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? 
pos/cv068_13400.txt the character of orlock is , of course , dracula . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt just thought that was an interesting little side note . . . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more " modern " version better . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . 
pos/cv068_13400.txt if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .

pos/cv564_11110.txt metro i've seen san francisco in movies many times . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt there was 1994's interview with the vampire and most recently the rock . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt now , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd . he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt when his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt meanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex-girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who's an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport ) . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt despite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way ? ) 
pos/cv564_11110.txt where the sgt . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt assigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc . , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt eddie murphy shines in this tailor-made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt when confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt michael rappaport is basically throwaway . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt he serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt typical action escapist fare . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott's perfectly raspy voice . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt i don't know . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt what i do know , though , is that although metro is basically a typical action retread , it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches' . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt the film is a triumph , and an entertaining one at that . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt it doesn't meander or trail off from its main character . 
pos/cv564_11110.txt an enjoyable two hours , metro is enjoyable , witty , action-packed , and fun , and makes for a great action movie that's perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality . 


pos/cv959_14611.txt

pos/cv959_14611.txt an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt alice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt alice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt sevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt for example , there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt but their are slight flaws with the movie . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt firstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80's , the characters are very , very 90's . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt although the male hairstyles look slightly 80's , frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed , which is a shame . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt also , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt finally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt some of the characters are very slight , which is a shame . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt the conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt but despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's . 
pos/cv959_14611.txt worth a look .

pos/cv117_24295.txt

pos/cv117_24295.txt just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt why is this ? 
pos/cv117_24295.txt maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt the plot in three words is : women and music . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . 
pos/cv117_24295.txt i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . 


pos/cv212_10027.txt

pos/cv212_10027.txt ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , 
pos/cv212_10027.txt synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt will rudy defeat leo ? 
pos/cv212_10027.txt will he enjoy being a lawyer ? 
pos/cv212_10027.txt opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt 'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . 
pos/cv212_10027.txt the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .

pos/cv989_15824.txt lisa cholodenko's " high art , " is an intelligent , quiet drama . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , " frame . " 
pos/cv989_15824.txt she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt lucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the " frame " editors to do a piece on her work . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt  " high art , " is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd's luck begins to rise . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt with this picture , ally sheedy's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her , is heartbreaking . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , " love and other catastrophes , " wh caught me by surprise with her performance . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt easily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt as accurate as almost every detail is in , " high art , " i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt this is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt the character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the " frame " editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt for once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . 
pos/cv989_15824.txt  " high art , " which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy's strongest , and best , role to date . 


pos/cv685_5947.txt

pos/cv685_5947.txt for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? 
pos/cv685_5947.txt harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? 
pos/cv685_5947.txt with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt  " why do we put up with it ? " 
pos/cv685_5947.txt emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt  " we try to talk about it , and look what happens . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt we fight for 20 minutes . " 
pos/cv685_5947.txt there's the admirable crux of this picture . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt  " subvert the patriarchy , " emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt  ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) 
pos/cv685_5947.txt perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( " who you callin' a bitch ? " ) . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . 's 
pos/cv685_5947.txt michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt the movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . 
pos/cv685_5947.txt for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . 


pos/cv974_22941.txt

pos/cv974_22941.txt  ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) 
pos/cv974_22941.txt we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt she can't go higher than him . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt he won't allow it . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt and what's amazing about " election " is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around " nice " persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt it's with mandy barnett's " if you'll be the teacher " playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( " drop dead gorgeous " leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen " ferris bueller's day off " . 
pos/cv974_22941.txt whatever .
