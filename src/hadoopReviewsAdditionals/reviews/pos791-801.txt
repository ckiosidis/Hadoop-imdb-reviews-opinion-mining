pos/cv943_22488.txt if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt while luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt as tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt however , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt she also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt the clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt a great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . 
pos/cv943_22488.txt _titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice .

pos/cv611_21120.txt john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt the bad : no scares . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt 'vampires' definately could have been done better . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt john carpenter does a great job of directing this film . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt you enjoy the time you spent and go on . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining . 
pos/cv611_21120.txt 'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer . 


pos/cv644_17154.txt

pos/cv644_17154.txt it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing " a simple plan " to , say , " rear window " or " strangers on a train . " 
pos/cv644_17154.txt yet it's almost as good . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , " a simple plan " concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt  " a simple plan , " though borrows a little from each of these . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch " persona " 's " sex scene " and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra " they can't do this , can they ? " 
pos/cv644_17154.txt streeming through my head . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] " fargo , " has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then 
pos/cv644_17154.txt again , after seeing the " evil dead " films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed " raimi " moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in " primary colors , " a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt even fonda shows off her talents nicely . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt i won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like if in " crime and punishment " if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i'm at all comparing " a simple plan " to dostoevsky . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . 
pos/cv644_17154.txt at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . 


pos/cv161_11425.txt

pos/cv161_11425.txt synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt sometimes it's a character sketch . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt fang's family is thoroughly americanized . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt his wife can't cook chinese . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt meanwhile fang's beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit . ' 
pos/cv161_11425.txt her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity ( homosexuals running the streets ) , and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt there is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after the month-long vacation . 
pos/cv161_11425.txt the film is neither here nor there ; it's a neutral , meandering , gentle , portrait of life on both sides .

pos/cv519_14661.txt many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . . . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt one member even had to be awakened after the film ended . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt don't believe the previews that you see . . . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt this is definitely not a film for everyone . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt think of the film city of angels . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but due to it's story , i doubt it will . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but don't get me wrong . . . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt i hope the film does do well . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the only film that surpasses it is dark city . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris " christy " nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris decides to leave her alone . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt little does he realize what will happen next . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt  " we're soul mates ! " 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris exclaims . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but what dreams may come goes a different route . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt chris' heaven is his memories brought to life . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt  " i've never seen anyone use real paint before , " albert says . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt instead , it's a state of being . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his " tracker " ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's truly a frightening sequence . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it is , after all , just a movie . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt however , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt cuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he's certainly not distracting . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt max von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris' father lost in the sea of faces . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt it's not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt overall , it's williams and sciorra's film . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt what dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt some will find the plot distracting . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt some will find the visuals absolutely glorious . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt and some will find both . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( " what " becomes " wet " and you should understand ) . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt in actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet . 
pos/cv519_14661.txt just thought i should let you know . 


pos/cv908_16009.txt

pos/cv908_16009.txt i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt this one , however , is shockingly not bad . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt in fact , it's actually good . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt because it's cute and innocent fun . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt because the lead star is immensely appealing . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt because the parents are also immensely appealing . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's " wonderful world of disney , " where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like " lady and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original " parent trap . " 
pos/cv908_16009.txt it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt there , they become friends , then learn about eachother . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt but she comes off just as appealing as she did once . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt this all brings this new " parent trap " to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : " it takes two " starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . 
pos/cv908_16009.txt as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . 


pos/cv200_2915.txt

pos/cv200_2915.txt a common complaint amongst film critics is " why aren't there more literate scripts available ? " 
pos/cv200_2915.txt quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt redford departs from the usually overlight , " cable tv quality " sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt although i was only 4 years old when the " twenty one " scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without " disposable income , " before the manifestation of its american dream . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from " the good life , " to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt though the 50s audience that is " rocked " by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt at the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . 
pos/cv200_2915.txt like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this " mirror " may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with .

pos/cv598_16452.txt in " magic town " , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a " perfect " town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt however , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he's doing is wrong . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt the plot is standard stuff , but that's not important . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt in a film like this , it's the calibre of the actors that make or break it . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt obviously , since stewart stars , that's practically a non-issue . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt he's great in the film , as usual . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt there's just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he's deceiving the town folk . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt you're always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . 
pos/cv598_16452.txt the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows .

pos/cv598_16452.txt  " magic town " is a delightfully entertaining motion picture .

pos/cv341_24430.txt

pos/cv341_24430.txt more than forty years ago , the " sword and sandals " genre of historical epic ruled the box office . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " ben-hur . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " cleopatra . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " the robe . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " sparticus . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " the fall of the roman empire . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " quo vadis . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( " the last emperor , " " braveheart " ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( " roots , " " shogun " ) . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt yet , the phrase " we who are about to die salute you " has been absent until now . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " gladiator " begins in germania in a . d . 180 . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . ) 
pos/cv341_24430.txt an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt the similarities to " braveheart " are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt also , like mel gibson's epic , " gladiator " has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt it's a simple tale of good versus evil . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  " gladiator " is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a " chick flick " be a " dick flick " ? ) . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) 
pos/cv341_24430.txt lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt i've been a russell crowe fan since " romper stomper . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in " l . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt a . confidential " and " the insider " -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt my only major quibble with " gladiator " is its stylized look . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt several scenes are tinted . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in " payback " and " the matrix . " 
pos/cv341_24430.txt i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt in " payback " it was merely annoying , but in " gladiator " it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) 
pos/cv341_24430.txt also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt  ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) 
pos/cv341_24430.txt with a more realistic look , " gladiator " could be even more satisfying than " braveheart " because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . 
pos/cv341_24430.txt bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .
