neg/cv173_4295.txt i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! 
neg/cv173_4295.txt i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt i got it . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt this movie really sucks . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! ! 
neg/cv173_4295.txt for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ? 
neg/cv173_4295.txt jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt i didn't even finish the movie . . . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt i couldn't take it anymore . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt aditya panscholi is the sidekick again . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt  ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little . 
neg/cv173_4295.txt he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )

neg/cv242_11354.txt  " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt but overall , who cares ? 
neg/cv242_11354.txt not me . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? 
neg/cv242_11354.txt the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt wow , they got idea credit ! 
neg/cv242_11354.txt i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let's make a movie ! " 
neg/cv242_11354.txt the supporting cast fares well . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt one question though : george wendt ? 
neg/cv242_11354.txt you'd think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt well , not the two who sat directly behind me . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again . 
neg/cv242_11354.txt maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

neg/cv012_29411.txt and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . 
neg/cv012_29411.txt chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! 
neg/cv012_29411.txt and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production .

neg/cv082_11979.txt edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt if she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt he skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even 
neg/cv082_11979.txt for claudia . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or 
neg/cv082_11979.txt should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt unfortunately , it seems much much longer . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , 
neg/cv082_11979.txt right . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt lauren holly does what she can with her central character . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and 
neg/cv082_11979.txt we never really care . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt there's not much to recommend in no looking back . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt it's not that the film is bad . . . it's 
neg/cv082_11979.txt simply boring . 
neg/cv082_11979.txt there's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it .

neg/cv099_11189.txt pepper's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt derived from the lyrics of various beatles' songs , sgt . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt pepper's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt of course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story doesn't correlate to the song at all . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt and oh , what joy - we're the lovely audience they'd like to take home with them . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt i don't think so . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! 
neg/cv099_11189.txt steve martin ? ! ? 
neg/cv099_11189.txt alice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70's fashion and faces . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt check please ! 
neg/cv099_11189.txt the plot is a bit unclear . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt people with bad 70's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt mean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co .

neg/cv099_11189.txt supposedly this is a horrible thing ? 
neg/cv099_11189.txt i guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent . 
neg/cv099_11189.txt meanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic " sex , drugs , and rock n' roll " thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy .

neg/cv891_6035.txt

neg/cv891_6035.txt depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . 
neg/cv891_6035.txt in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . 


neg/cv406_22199.txt

neg/cv406_22199.txt i still can't figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt now before you go assuming i'm some sort of high brow snob , who can't appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt i thought there's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt i wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt actually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt not a great record for a 90-minute film . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt nothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt it's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt sandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt the team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt you can figure out the rest from here . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt as i said , the film had a great deal of potential . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt the idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt all of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt even sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt even as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt if their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt fairuza balk plays sandler's leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt winkler is great as the coach who uses a " coaching for dummies " -style book to help him get through games . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt the real standout though , is kathy bates . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler's overprotective and overbearing mama . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt even with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt although i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt which is sad , because i can't really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . 
neg/cv406_22199.txt it's obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie .

neg/cv685_5710.txt steve martin shines but sgt . bilko 
neg/cv685_5710.txt fails to impress 
neg/cv685_5710.txt based on the popular 50's sitcom , sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? 
neg/cv685_5710.txt  ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt sgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt though materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt to add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt director jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt there are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt still , steve martin's sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt without him , sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko would have just fell flat on its face . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt sgt . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt the current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt unless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres . 
neg/cv685_5710.txt i'm sure there are better ones around . 


neg/cv771_28466.txt

neg/cv771_28466.txt plot : lara croft is british , rich and kicks a lot of ass . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years , and that lara holds the key to time , well , needless to say , they want to nab it from her . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt oh yeah , lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts . . . hummana-hummana-hummana . . . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt critique : angelina jolie was great in this movie . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt there were also about three " action scenes " that were pretty cool to look at in this film . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt uhhhhhm , unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked ! 
neg/cv771_28466.txt bad dialogue , generic sidekicks and bad guys , a lame mystery , yoda-esque moments with mumbo-jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt all in all , this movie wasn't the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about , especially since every other scene does feature jolie's torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts , but it was quite the letdown nonetheless , especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool , hip woman hero , based on a popular video game . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt i don't know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who didn't really tie the whole movie together all that well . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt the film lacked energy , a consistent pace and well . . . a 
neg/cv771_28466.txt fun time ! 
neg/cv771_28466.txt i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt all that " father " crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing ( and i'm not even gonna mention his moustache . . . hehehe ) . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt why have this shite in the movie at all ? ! ? 
neg/cv771_28466.txt i especially hated the scenes in which some ghost-like figure , friend or child would ramble on about lara croft's father while all the time , i'm not giving one ounce of crap as to what they're talking about . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt i guess that's called lack of " character development " , right ? 
neg/cv771_28466.txt that's when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen , so that we could actually " get into " it and care about them . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt i didn't care about anyone in this movie , and was bored during most of its " let's explain why we're doing all this gobbledygook " moments . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass ( damn , did she look sexy blasting those guns or what ? ! ? ) , everybody else around her was so goddamn boring ! 
neg/cv771_28466.txt her butler was a throwaway with no personality , her side-kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word " bugger " ( and he says it a lot , trust me ! ) and all of the so-called bad guys just spewed one-dimension ! 
neg/cv771_28466.txt they had no spark , no energy amongst them , and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool ( see the trailer and you'll know which ones i'm talking about ) , the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull-crap just buried it even further . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt also , for a movie that's supposed to be about all of these exotic locations , i wasn't necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots , and even less so with its interiors , which all looked like they were shot in the same room . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt mind you , i won't go as far as to say that it's the " worst movie of the year " ( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr . movies also ! ) , but it's definitely the worst film that i've seen during this summer movie season ( of course , it's still early and i'm sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike ) . 
neg/cv771_28466.txt skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead . . . trust 
neg/cv771_28466.txt me , you'll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock-solid porn and it's all good ! 
neg/cv771_28466.txt where's joblo coming from ?

neg/cv113_24354.txt

neg/cv113_24354.txt one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt his reasons ? 
neg/cv113_24354.txt well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt the audience should now hate this character . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt i did . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt then the meat of the plot presents itself . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster's millions ? " . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says " what is this , brewster's millions ? " 
neg/cv113_24354.txt it was quite surreal . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt this goes on for the rest of the film . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt my groans of disgust could be heard for miles . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . 
neg/cv113_24354.txt so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? 
neg/cv113_24354.txt ugh .
