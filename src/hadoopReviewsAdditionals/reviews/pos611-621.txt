pos/cv535_19728.txt it's a curious thing - i've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he's much better and so is the movie . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt even though , in the sixth sense he is the " name " , he doesn't have the pivotal role . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt if osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt we get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i've seen this year . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt the whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt one thing about this movie , its target . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt this isn't a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt one caveat : there's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , don't let them . 
pos/cv535_19728.txt let the director explain on his own pace and you'll enjoy the movie vastly more . 


pos/cv875_5754.txt

pos/cv875_5754.txt every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt see the best film i have seen in 1996 . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt not the best children's film . . . the 
pos/cv875_5754.txt best film . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt period . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because " i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . " 
pos/cv875_5754.txt more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . 
pos/cv875_5754.txt and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . 


pos/cv070_12289.txt

pos/cv070_12289.txt close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' " a clockwork orange . " 
pos/cv070_12289.txt a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of " delicatessen , " or " the tin drum . " 
pos/cv070_12289.txt imagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from " the butcher boy . " 
pos/cv070_12289.txt imagine that and more . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt neil jordan's latest film " stars " rea in more ways than one . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's " the crying game , " contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's " performance " worth watching , worth listening to . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt and that's only half the fun . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of " the butcher boy , " owens commands virtually every frame . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt it's impossible to take your eyes off him . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt in fact , everything was ok until " the nugent " came to town . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( " the butcher boy " is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt  " pigs ! " screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt  " you're all pigs ! " 
pos/cv070_12289.txt it's the start of many a related image . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt after ma brady is shipped off to the " garage " for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt squealing like a stuck pig , francie does " the likes o' that " on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for " boney arsed bogmen , " where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt director jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt it's not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt it's bleak and it's black but it's fundamentally very funny . 
pos/cv070_12289.txt rea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make " the butcher boy " a film worth savoring . 


pos/cv821_29364.txt

pos/cv821_29364.txt an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the reason ? 
pos/cv821_29364.txt mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . . 
pos/cv821_29364.txt or if our passports weren't missing . 


pos/cv871_24888.txt

pos/cv871_24888.txt  " well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it's mission : impossible . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt difficult should be a walk in the park for you . " 
pos/cv871_24888.txt ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt after that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt as far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) . 
pos/cv871_24888.txt even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .

pos/cv224_17661.txt in 1977 , something never though possible happened . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the film set a new standard for special effects in film . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt not only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt darth vader is the leader of the dark side . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt ben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt darth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side .

pos/cv224_17661.txt star wars is an amazing epic . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch .

pos/cv224_17661.txt in early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . 
pos/cv224_17661.txt the film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 .

pos/cv272_18974.txt

pos/cv272_18974.txt in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt in terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt she is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt she not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt the young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt i mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one . 
pos/cv272_18974.txt not much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life .

pos/cv855_20661.txt 10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family " no dating " policy is amended to " bianca can date . . . when 
pos/cv855_20661.txt [katarina] does . " 
pos/cv855_20661.txt with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister " . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . " 
pos/cv855_20661.txt getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit " someone with money . " 
pos/cv855_20661.txt in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that " hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . " 
pos/cv855_20661.txt the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait . 
pos/cv855_20661.txt yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .

pos/cv047_1754.txt -- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- 
pos/cv047_1754.txt summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! 
pos/cv047_1754.txt to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt matinee is not like that . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt he is highly expressive both physically and vocally . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt  ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) 
pos/cv047_1754.txt while mant ! 
pos/cv047_1754.txt never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! 
pos/cv047_1754.txt serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . 
pos/cv047_1754.txt enjoy !
