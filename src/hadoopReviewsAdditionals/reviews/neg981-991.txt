neg/cv420_28631.txt plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt oh yeah , there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me , you won't care much about the " plot " in this film . . . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt it's like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink ) . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt and the scariest part of it all ? 
neg/cv420_28631.txt check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt i say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half-assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt now i'm not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed " funny sketch " ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on " saturday night live " . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt there are a couple of funny one-liners , but mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film's website isn't even up yet ! ! ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt what the f * * * ? ! ? ) . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt i do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take-off-- miss this and you've missed any reason to see the flick ) . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt i especially liked his one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman's head turning . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt very funny ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt unfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where's my car , and other action movies like charlie's angels and mission impossible 2 . now help me figure this one out , will you ? 
neg/cv420_28631.txt isn't this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? 
neg/cv420_28631.txt  ( or maybe that's just the title of the film f-ing with my head ) . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt well , i'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt unfortunately for us , all we're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might've been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt but as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year's film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough " real " effort into this chop-job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt pooh on you ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt  ( that's telling 'em , joblo ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt sheesh ) 
neg/cv420_28631.txt btw , i'm allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson , whose massive breasts and skanky g-string had me chompin' at the bit . 
neg/cv420_28631.txt you go , girl ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt everyone else . . . stay ! 
neg/cv420_28631.txt where's joblo coming from ?

neg/cv717_17472.txt starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt so much for hopes . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 
neg/cv717_17472.txt well , it must have to the producers of junior . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? 
neg/cv717_17472.txt anything would have been better than this mess . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt danny devito is wasted in this movie . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt  ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) 
neg/cv717_17472.txt emma thompson is wasted here as well . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt am i being too hard on this film ? 
neg/cv717_17472.txt i don't think so . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt they certainly managed here . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . 
neg/cv717_17472.txt if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents .

neg/cv110_27832.txt annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) , a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt annie is something of a psychic , she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt her " gift " leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court ? 
neg/cv110_27832.txt do they even have the right man ? 
neg/cv110_27832.txt what's good about it : 
neg/cv110_27832.txt aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale , there is little else going for the film . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt what's not so good about it : 
neg/cv110_27832.txt lame , unoriginal screenplay . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt predictable ending . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt suspense scenes that are just plain boring . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant , hateful goobers . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt overall critique : 
neg/cv110_27832.txt  " the gift " is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you've seen this story before . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt it's a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made , and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that's really saying something . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt for an established , talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt it's predictable from the first scene , the screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn't actually do it . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt it's no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt sigh , how trite . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it's so cliche . 
neg/cv110_27832.txt  " the gift " is basically a glorified b-movie . 


neg/cv558_29376.txt

neg/cv558_29376.txt synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt danny falls in love with rafe's girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt meanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt review : " pearl harbor " is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt it is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt sadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing " pearl harbor " with his left . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt the plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt instead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , " i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant " , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt to the movie's credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war . 
neg/cv558_29376.txt if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching . 


neg/cv592_23391.txt

neg/cv592_23391.txt the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt such popular and noteworthy tomes as " stranger in a strange land " by robert heinlein , " childhood's end " by arthur c . clarke and " man in the high castle " and " do androids dream of electric sheep " by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel " rocketship galileo " and crafted the film " destination moon " , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt with the release of touchstone pictures " mission to mars " , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt luc consoles jim with woody's assistance . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt a strange noise emanates from the rock . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
neg/cv592_23391.txt now for the bad news . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the entire plot of " mission to mars " is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt borrowing ideas from such films as " robinson crusoe on mars " ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , " 2001 : a space odyssey " , and even mario bava's " planet of the vampires " ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , " mission to mars " is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt he's just having too much fun here to give a damn . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt subtlety is non-existent here . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the pacing of the film is very leisurely . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since " 2001 : a space odyssey " . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's " rope " ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt sadly it is not . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt the set design and visual effects are all arresting . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . 
neg/cv592_23391.txt a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .

neg/cv819_9567.txt  " the specliast " of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt his credo is killing bad people , not innocents . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt and that's why he makes big bombs . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt yea . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt it's just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt then there's the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on " friends . " 
neg/cv819_9567.txt their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt now let's guess who we'd rather see naked , okay ? 
neg/cv819_9567.txt stone's small but perky breasts , which we've seen more times than harvey keitel's dick , or stallone's veiny ass , which isn't usually shown for a very good reason ? 
neg/cv819_9567.txt i know i can't really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt the worst flaw of the film is this : it's boring . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt if you're in for some fun action , rent sly's earlier " demolition man , " which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . 
neg/cv819_9567.txt skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger's accent , or see stone's breasts again .

neg/cv696_29619.txt fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt fair enough . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 " this is a no-no " dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on " it won't hurt ! " 
neg/cv696_29619.txt for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics ) . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate .

neg/cv696_29619.txt to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt i don't care . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt gender be damned , she's borderline inept . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt don't be fooled . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence .

neg/cv696_29619.txt sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .

neg/cv696_29619.txt what's more , she might even like it . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat's extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt . 
neg/cv696_29619.txt fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .

neg/cv660_23140.txt

neg/cv660_23140.txt are you like me ? 
neg/cv660_23140.txt do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? 
neg/cv660_23140.txt well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt aaaaaaaahhhh . . . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt and i'm being nice ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt how junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt wow . . . how 
neg/cv660_23140.txt deep . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt of course , the same christmas tune that's played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build " bonds " among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt stop me . . . i'm 
neg/cv660_23140.txt gonna cry again ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt this film is a mess . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt the characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an " emotional " moment about movie stars from the 50s . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt admittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt enough already ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt and diane keaton must've spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt neither one convinced in " emotional " scenes . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt granted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that's probably where my rating of three points comes from . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt all in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you're one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( " oh no , please don't get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt ugh . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt that'll teach 'em to mess with you ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt oh and incidentally , mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there ! 
neg/cv660_23140.txt then again . . . maybe 
neg/cv660_23140.txt you'll like it . 
neg/cv660_23140.txt  : ) 


neg/cv285_18186.txt

neg/cv285_18186.txt in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . 
neg/cv285_18186.txt all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time .
