pos/cv906_11491.txt niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . 
pos/cv906_11491.txt but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

pos/cv840_16321.txt the question isn't why has grease been reissued . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? 
pos/cv840_16321.txt the answer is not an easy one . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt ok , let's not be a spoilsport . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt between grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt secondly , a lack of talent . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . 
pos/cv840_16321.txt let grease be the word that sparks this revival .

pos/cv777_10094.txt anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt nevertheless , " poetic " is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt there is comedy and tragedy . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt these two have a stormy relationship . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt it's the ceremony that they're interested in . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the acting is strong and believable . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . 
pos/cv777_10094.txt if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater . 


pos/cv969_13250.txt

pos/cv969_13250.txt allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of " out of sight , " as the maid of a crooked financier . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt in keeping with her past performances , allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria's secret ensemble which begs the question , did they really need a costume designer for this ? 
pos/cv969_13250.txt  " out of sight " is not likely to secure ms . allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , " jackie brown , " but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the " also starring " credits given her limited screen time . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt the real stars of " out of sight " are george clooney ( " batman & robin " by way of " e . r . " ) and jennifer lopez ( " selena " ) , whose winning chemistry , coupled with steven soderbergh's freeze-frame directorial technique , help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard's original work . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt with the success of " get shorty " three years ago , filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt in " out of sight , " clooney stars as jack foley , a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery--he just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal , claiming that his " partner " ( just another customer it so happens ) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn't comply . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt for all of jack's nice-guy charm though , he's not very lucky . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt his latest scam lands him in florida's glades correctional facility . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt federal marshal karen sisco ( lopez ) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ( ving rhames , typically appealing ) are breaking out . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt there's a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt it's in these cramped confines , pressed intimately together , that jack and karen start falling for one another . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt the mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another's grasp . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt karen follows jack to detroit , where he's about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes ) . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt it's during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt clooney's range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt lopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt she dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt especially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt admirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice 'snoopy' miller , steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels , and dennis farina as karen's dad , who affectionately buys her a piece . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt add a couple of uncredited cameos from " jackie brown " cast members and " out of sight " proves to be a lot of fun . 
pos/cv969_13250.txt not as hip and clever as " shorty , " perhaps , or as complex and colorful as " brown , " but loads of fun nonetheless .

pos/cv945_12160.txt

pos/cv945_12160.txt there is a striking scene early in " city of angels , " where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt it is an important scene for several reasons . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like " angels in the outfield " ( 1994 ) or " michael " ( 1996 ) . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt the angels here are stark and believable . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt  " city of angels " is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to " fall " and become human . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( " n . y . p . d . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt blue " ) in a touching and humorous performance . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt  " city of angels " is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film " wings of desire . " 
pos/cv945_12160.txt wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt this may be because director brad silberling ( " casper " ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( " blink " ) wanted to make " city of angels " its own movie - inspired by " wings of desire , " but not an attempt to copy it . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt and yet , " city of angels " is not a typical hollywood movie . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( " the english patient " ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt what is most striking about " city of angels " is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . 
pos/cv945_12160.txt instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive .

pos/cv750_10180.txt

pos/cv750_10180.txt what's shocking about " carlito's way " is how good it is . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , " scent of a woman , " and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , " carlito's way " was destined for underrated heaven . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt  " carlito's way " deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco " from the bronx " ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt like " apollo 13 , " we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt his earlier flim , " scarface " ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as " strong " as his oscar-winning role in " scent of a woman . " 
pos/cv750_10180.txt well , his " scent of a woman " performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a " foghorn leghorn impression . " 
pos/cv750_10180.txt in " carlito's way , " he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in " scent of a woman . " 
pos/cv750_10180.txt as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt and they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt every scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt  " carlito's way " is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you're absolutely blown away . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt it's a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn't do so hot . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt but trust me and check it out . 
pos/cv750_10180.txt it's a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . 


pos/cv193_5416.txt

pos/cv193_5416.txt on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt here's what the two movies do have in common . . . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt --scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf 
pos/cv193_5416.txt reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino's chin ) . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt most of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt mr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt the story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's " like a virgin . " 
pos/cv193_5416.txt another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv193_5416.txt reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction . 


pos/cv500_10251.txt

pos/cv500_10251.txt losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt  " i don't think people listen to guys like me , " sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to " just listen " , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won't be provided for . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt he's not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he's somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped any by the fact that banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt overall , he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we'd deem " far enough " as the starting mark of some crazy race . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt covering a " fluff " story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could've hoped for . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt max immediately bonds with sam . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt at first , max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam's honest ambitions . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt then there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt she falls under max's wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt kirshner's credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt still , kirshner's character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt i wouldn't mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt there is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could've fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt this isn't a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . 
pos/cv500_10251.txt if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out . 


pos/cv105_17990.txt

pos/cv105_17990.txt on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt he is insane , apparently . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt bad cutting puts the timing way out . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt in other words , he's almost in two places at once . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the injury ? 
pos/cv105_17990.txt he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! 
pos/cv105_17990.txt thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! 
pos/cv105_17990.txt that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? 
pos/cv105_17990.txt because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . 
pos/cv105_17990.txt proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .
