pos/cv794_15868.txt  " the faculty , " the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's " desperado " and 1996's " from dusk till dawn " ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's " scream " and 1997's " scream 2 " ) , is being called a cross between " invasion of the body snatchers " and " the breakfast club , " and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the six characters , as in " the breakfast club , " can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt  " the faculty " is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original " scream , " and rodriguez , whose " from dusk till dawn " is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the plotline of " the faculty , " involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from " invasion of the body snatchers , " to " the puppet masters , " to " invaders from mars , " so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the performances in " the faculty " were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( " t2 : judgement day " ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the " queen " alien , many of the faculty members disappear . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , " the faculty " is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . 
pos/cv794_15868.txt if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving .

pos/cv792_3832.txt john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt  ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet . ) 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the first half of the film has something to offer , as " sil , " the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation's " counselor cleavage . " 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt h . r . giger's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn't live up to it . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of " scare " scenes stuck together . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt on the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . 
pos/cv792_3832.txt my personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don't enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters .

pos/cv464_15650.txt swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt banderas motive ? 
pos/cv464_15650.txt to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the audience does hate them , which can't be bad . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well .

pos/cv464_15650.txt although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . 
pos/cv464_15650.txt you won't regret it . 


pos/cv446_11353.txt

pos/cv446_11353.txt  " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the film definately has it's flaws . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him " how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? " 
pos/cv446_11353.txt which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the thing is , it's a vaild point . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? 
pos/cv446_11353.txt what's the greater good here ? 
pos/cv446_11353.txt many lives or one life ? 
pos/cv446_11353.txt if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about " desperate measures " outnumber the bad . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the main highlight would be keaton's performance . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt he's not as menacing as he was in " pacific heights " or even as menacing as he was in " batman " ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you've seen a billion times before . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . 
pos/cv446_11353.txt but it doesn't , and that's creative .

pos/cv537_12370.txt before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt it is the latest entry in this decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film , and the first of two " the sky is falling " flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt its tagline , " oceans rise . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt cities fall . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt hope survives " is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( " they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt is together " ) , but it's every bit as treacly . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening " roll call , " in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the most prominent of the " personal " stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc's cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film's ostensible main character . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante's peak , but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt having passed the " er challenge " in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt there's nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny's familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon " fish " tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . 
pos/cv537_12370.txt although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the '90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn't as deep as hoped . 


pos/cv589_12064.txt

pos/cv589_12064.txt whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt he made the west dirty in " mccabe and mrs . miller " ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in " the long goodbye " ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with " popeye " ( 1980 ) . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt the same holds true for his most recent film , " the gingerbread man , " which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt by the time " the gingerbread man " was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , " the gingerbread man " is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been " screwing around . " 
pos/cv589_12064.txt after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does " weird " stuff like that . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt as another character puts it , dixon is " a few beers short of six-pack . " 
pos/cv589_12064.txt rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt  " the gingerbread man " is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in " schindler's list " ( 1993 ) . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt while " the gingerbread man " isn't in league with altman's greatest works like " nashville " ( 1975 ) or " the player " ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt some critics love to stamp films like this as " commercial , " as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money . 
pos/cv589_12064.txt altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .

pos/cv587_19162.txt the happy bastard's quick movie review 
pos/cv587_19162.txt me tarzan . . . you 
pos/cv587_19162.txt happy viewer . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt  ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? 
pos/cv587_19162.txt yikes ! ) 
pos/cv587_19162.txt but guess what- disney , a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? 
pos/cv587_19162.txt the voicework here is pretty top-level . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne " newman " knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt and the music's not half bad , either . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt fortunately , there's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt there's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . 
pos/cv587_19162.txt this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that 
pos/cv587_19162.txt is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 . 


pos/cv853_29233.txt

pos/cv853_29233.txt my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt at first , briggs doesn't want to be there . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt greenfingers , which is " inspired by actual events , " becomes a bit like a sports movie after that . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not " prison love " ) . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt the movie deals with people and scores on that concept . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter " burns the sunday roast . " 
pos/cv853_29233.txt nothing is forced in greenfingers . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so . 
pos/cv853_29233.txt after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well . 


pos/cv187_12829.txt

pos/cv187_12829.txt weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece " zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's " wife " ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . 
pos/cv187_12829.txt they wear buttons asking `how will it end ? ' 
pos/cv187_12829.txt i couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . 


pos/cv890_3977.txt

pos/cv890_3977.txt apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt if they ever reach it . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . 
pos/cv890_3977.txt you should enjoy it .
