neg/cv525_17930.txt one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , " warped , twisted masterpiece " of lynch clan . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt the actors aren't good either . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's " regular " girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . 
neg/cv525_17930.txt all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger's career .

neg/cv393_29234.txt not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt real westerns . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt these were some of the best films of the twentieth century . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt those days are gone . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . 
neg/cv393_29234.txt instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago . 


neg/cv477_23530.txt

neg/cv477_23530.txt the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt however , fate is not so easily bested , and alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt essentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt unfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt as far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt there is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential " roller coaster " type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt unfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . 
neg/cv477_23530.txt other than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable .

neg/cv214_13285.txt for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt his final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt this he refuses do and runs . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt tut tut . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt chow's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that's damned unforgiveable . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt  ( did he have no say so at all ? ) 
neg/cv214_13285.txt watch 'the killer' again and weep at the difference . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt review by chris hill . 
neg/cv214_13285.txt  " there's room at the top , they are telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill , if you want to be like the folks on the hill . " 


neg/cv354_8573.txt

neg/cv354_8573.txt wow , a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt i'm amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves , and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt even i'm offended by it . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt bill bellamy is a " player " which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt what a pleasant main character . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt one day , his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt why they decide this " one day " i have no idea . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn ? 
neg/cv354_8573.txt anyway , bellamy agrees to teach , and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt this is the bulk of the film folks , guys riding from house to house , one keeps getting out to have sex , while the others sit in the car . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt since russell simmons is producer , and since the official title of the film is " def jam's how to be a player " , i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt amazingly , aside from gilbert gottfried's 90 seconds of screen time , there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt instead of jokes , there's just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts ( and naked breasts aren't so bad , but naked breasts alone don't make a good movie ) . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt gilbert gottfried's character serves as one in his very brief appearance , asking for explanations as to what is being said . 
neg/cv354_8573.txt they should have brought him along for the entire film .

neg/cv302_26481.txt

neg/cv302_26481.txt the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt so i didn't expect too much from this . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! 
neg/cv302_26481.txt what happens . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but he gets unexpected help from the house itself . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt is that exciting or what ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt  " the blair witch project " , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt and with a $70 mill . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt de ! 
neg/cv302_26481.txt bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but why give him a more serious material ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt in the end " haunting " will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but this is where the good things end . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt at first you do not know what's going on . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt is this part of the experiment ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt are these hallucinations ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt projections of the subconscience ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt paranoia ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt the house is actually possessed . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
neg/cv302_26481.txt i believe hichock once said that " it's ! 
neg/cv302_26481.txt better to wait for a climax , than to see one " . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt they are impossible to take seriously . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's " the shining " , are absolutely baseless . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt  " shining " had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt  " haunting " has only special effects and art direction to boast of . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . 
neg/cv302_26481.txt but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " . 


neg/cv855_22134.txt

neg/cv855_22134.txt vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt which brings me to the best moment of the film . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . 
neg/cv855_22134.txt too bad .

neg/cv021_17313.txt

neg/cv021_17313.txt  " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . " 
neg/cv021_17313.txt he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt annette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt subplots appear and disappear . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt  " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt some questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt what about the computer ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt is the woman in australia integral to anything ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? 
neg/cv021_17313.txt sigh . 
neg/cv021_17313.txt at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste .

neg/cv006_17022.txt so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? 
neg/cv006_17022.txt is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? 
neg/cv006_17022.txt or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? 
neg/cv006_17022.txt i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt i'm talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt is " 8mm " something you really want to see ? 
neg/cv006_17022.txt probably not . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt trust me . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt there are better ways to waste two hours of your life . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt nicolas ' " snake eyes " ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt welles certainly makes it look easy . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's " hardcore . " 
neg/cv006_17022.txt occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt  " 8mm " doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt later it's the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . 
neg/cv006_17022.txt neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .
