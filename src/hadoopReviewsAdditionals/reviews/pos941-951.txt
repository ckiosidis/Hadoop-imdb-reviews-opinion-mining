pos/cv998_14111.txt steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , " saving private ryan " is flawless . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt literally . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the plot is simple enough . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt literally . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt this is what coppola was looking for in " apocalypse now " , but couldn't create . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt hanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt but that is forgivable . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt what isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the last sequence is atrocious . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt these flaws are what downgrade " ryan " from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt spielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie's theme . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt the power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . 
pos/cv998_14111.txt this is the film of the year . 


pos/cv271_13837.txt

pos/cv271_13837.txt you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt this is not clear to lucas , however . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt the next scene is brilliant . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt but maggie is written smarter than that . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt the last third of the film revolves around this attempt . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt lucas is filled with great performances . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt forget everything you know about corey haim . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . 
pos/cv271_13837.txt it deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . 


pos/cv058_8025.txt

pos/cv058_8025.txt disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt  ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt some lack lyrical snap . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt others need more memorable melodies . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) 
pos/cv058_8025.txt so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble ! " ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas . 
pos/cv058_8025.txt directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black . 


pos/cv594_11039.txt

pos/cv594_11039.txt i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt i loved the wedding singer . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt but it gets worse . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt  . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt  . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt hell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i'm bound to be lynched . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ? 
pos/cv594_11039.txt you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt after all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? 
pos/cv594_11039.txt well , there's more . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt  . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt  . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt i actually got choked up , and more than once . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt yes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt but when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt in the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt julia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the " miami vice " loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn't seem all that interested . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt it's obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? 
pos/cv594_11039.txt this isn't sleepless in seattle , but i'd actually compare it to that before i'd compare it to happy gilmore . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt while the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt sandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt barrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt one scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt unfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it's got so much surprise substance packed inside that i'm encouraging everyone to go see it . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt in fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt it's hilarious , and it's touching . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt it's got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt this is one to see again and again . 
pos/cv594_11039.txt is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? 
pos/cv594_11039.txt my " magic 8-ball " predicts it is certain .

pos/cv392_11458.txt the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt even more remarkably , it works . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . 
pos/cv392_11458.txt with every good film the audience gains new knowledge .

pos/cv392_11458.txt oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .

pos/cv628_19325.txt seen july 4 , 1999 at 7 : 15 p . m . at crossgates cinemas 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #9 , by myself for free using my hoyts season pass . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture and seats] 
pos/cv628_19325.txt title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt ultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt and i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt cons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt running time is a bit short . 
pos/cv628_19325.txt would you recommend this to friends ?

pos/cv558_29507.txt  " the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition " 
pos/cv558_29507.txt in 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt 28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in " the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition . " 
pos/cv558_29507.txt the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt once on this " safe " haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt the title of this fascinating documentary , " the endurance , " is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt  ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , " south , " an interesting companion piece for " the endurance . " 
pos/cv558_29507.txt if shackleton's original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt as you watch the story of " the endurance " unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt  ( shackleton's amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) 
pos/cv558_29507.txt there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt actor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary's first half . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt as the crew's adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of " the endurance , " its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt i can't think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt  " the endurance , " based on caroline alexander's book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . 
pos/cv558_29507.txt i give it a b+ .

pos/cv988_18740.txt

pos/cv988_18740.txt i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt what a klutz ! 
pos/cv988_18740.txt george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the film is a treasure to look at . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt however , all the sets are so original . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt there is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . 
pos/cv988_18740.txt it is the best " fun " film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely .

pos/cv798_23531.txt fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt but the deputy sheriff " buggs " meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . 
pos/cv798_23531.txt he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience .
