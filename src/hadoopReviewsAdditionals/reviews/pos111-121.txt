pos/cv360_8398.txt regretfully it's only a movie .

pos/cv360_8398.txt  " it's your turn to be afraid , " he declares .

pos/cv360_8398.txt director wolfgang peterson ( " das boot " , " in the line of fire " , " outbreak " takes the over-used " die hard " theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity .

pos/cv360_8398.txt everyone is totally engrossed .

pos/cv360_8398.txt marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job . 
pos/cv360_8398.txt realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act .

pos/cv360_8398.txt the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here . 
pos/cv360_8398.txt no matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one . 
pos/cv360_8398.txt i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country's future : not a common belief nowadays . 
pos/cv360_8398.txt now if we only can get ford to run for president .

pos/cv049_20471.txt warning : contains what the matrix is . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt rated r for sci-fi violence . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano 
pos/cv049_20471.txt some may be disappointed with the matrix . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt i'll tell you i was . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt don't be fooled , this movie has a big story . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt and big chunks of talky moments . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt ok now to the story . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt well this may take a while . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt yeah there were some in the first half but not enough . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . 
pos/cv049_20471.txt one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained . 


pos/cv934_19027.txt

pos/cv934_19027.txt not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to " sit for him , " ( pose for a portrait ) . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's " locker room talk . " 
pos/cv934_19027.txt boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned " locker room talk , " and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . 
pos/cv934_19027.txt in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .

pos/cv743_15449.txt once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? 
pos/cv743_15449.txt as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . 
pos/cv743_15449.txt after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .

pos/cv904_24353.txt well i'll be damned . . . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt the canadians can make a good movie . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt the world is coming to an end . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt we don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt the world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt yet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt they aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end . . . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt some engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt these people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt writer-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt some moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt but i do wonder why the sun never sets . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt come midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt maybe the sun is crashing into the earth . . . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt who knows . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt also , it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that's not a shot at this film mind you . . . 
pos/cv904_24353.txt i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) .

pos/cv037_18510.txt

pos/cv037_18510.txt the event of events is upon us . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt anyone who tells you " it's just a movie " is either lying or clueless . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt in fact , it is terrific . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt he is an innocent slave boy , but " the force is strong with him " so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like " exqueeze me ? " 
pos/cv037_18510.txt and " mesa go now , okeday ? " , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt when you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " , when the familiar music plays , when the words " star wars " appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . 
pos/cv037_18510.txt it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .

pos/cv600_23878.txt rating : good shot ( stars ) 
pos/cv600_23878.txt languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era .

pos/cv600_23878.txt bullets have permanence . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt death has consequences . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty .

pos/cv600_23878.txt there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he craves nothing more . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt as he puts it late in the film , " i've seen all i want to see . " 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that " samaritan " being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill " handsome frank " , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey ) . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt by film's end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the other person in ghost dog's world is an ice cream ( de bankole' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt jarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt  ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost's dog's sense of honor . ) 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt of all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt gorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor's use , his face . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt ghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt although the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . 
pos/cv600_23878.txt carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity .

pos/cv064_24576.txt roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required " 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence " style of moviemaking . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt but i still don't know exactly how he did it . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt but he should have it now . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , " let's go see the new russell crowe movie " . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's both rousing and chilling . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt i've always been fascinated with reed . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt the film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt ironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt and like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt it's sad that such a good film has these distractions . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . 
pos/cv064_24576.txt however it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d .

pos/cv488_19856.txt it has happened again . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt it is involving , suspenseful . . . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt the sixth sense is that movie . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt not just in dreams . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt and not just as lifeless bodies . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt he sees them walking around like regular people . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt and he sees them all the time . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt dr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt but first he needs to gain cole's trust . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt about his " secrets . " 
pos/cv488_19856.txt crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt mr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt it is fine work for one of such a tender age . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt keep your eye on this young man . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt the supporting cast is also quite effective . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt twenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt in giving the sixth sense a favorable " three star " review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the " living dead . " 
pos/cv488_19856.txt the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , " thou shall not surely die , " a direct contradiction of god's admonition . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt an event which has not yet occurred . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound . 
pos/cv488_19856.txt and then , you'll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens . 


pos/cv195_14528.txt

pos/cv195_14528.txt there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt for fans of both genres , however , realism is key . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . 
pos/cv195_14528.txt since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit .
