pos/cv409_29786.txt the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of " human interconnectedness " and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best . 
pos/cv409_29786.txt he's that good .

pos/cv576_14094.txt as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt it has been done before with varying results . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt  . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt but , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . 
pos/cv576_14094.txt so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing

pos/cv374_25436.txt garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt after a few disastrous " mating " attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the " joys " of married life . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? 
pos/cv374_25436.txt is a very funny movie . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? 
pos/cv374_25436.txt could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of " less is more " . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) 
pos/cv374_25436.txt does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of " high hopes " for a lengthy period of time . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt what planet are you from ? 
pos/cv374_25436.txt is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? 
pos/cv374_25436.txt well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt what planet are your from ? 
pos/cv374_25436.txt was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video . 
pos/cv374_25436.txt this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .

pos/cv951_10926.txt how many of us would become strippers ? 
pos/cv951_10926.txt for those of us who wouldn't , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? 
pos/cv951_10926.txt that's probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt as you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? 
pos/cv951_10926.txt in case you haven't guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain't . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt what to do ? 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt these include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt when the sextet is complete , we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising " the full monty " on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt  . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt  . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt and i mean * all * . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt with the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt the amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt there's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn't be better . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt each character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt the full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could've easily fallen prey to tastelessness . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt it's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt either way you see it , it shouldn't let you down in the slightest . 
pos/cv951_10926.txt and , pun heavily intended , when it's all said and done , you'll be smiling from cheek to cheek . 


pos/cv323_29805.txt

pos/cv323_29805.txt this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt he has become an unquestioning weapon . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt but even assassins have innocent pasts . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt he was seen in the world is not enough . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt his lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt this is a world that is cold and unfriendly . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy's film all the way . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt it creates indelible images of evil . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos/cv323_29805.txt  ( i do hope they do not use the tagline " don't mess with mr . in-between . " ) 


pos/cv482_10580.txt

pos/cv482_10580.txt sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt the wings of the dove fits the pattern . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt but kate's " job " , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as " rich . " 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt he's not sure he can separate the two . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt one is left with feelings of regret and despair . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . 
pos/cv482_10580.txt still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .

pos/cv930_13475.txt there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three " oscars " , including the one for the best film . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of " sticking his neck for nobody " . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt the supporting actors also did a marvellous job . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . 
pos/cv930_13475.txt any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .

pos/cv677_17715.txt 'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed 
pos/cv677_17715.txt  ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) 
pos/cv677_17715.txt cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt walsh , jeff daniels 
pos/cv677_17715.txt mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements 
pos/cv677_17715.txt genre : drama 
pos/cv677_17715.txt in my opinion : 
pos/cv677_17715.txt in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ? 
pos/cv677_17715.txt i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some " healthy " immorality is not a world at all . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt that said , the plot goes as such . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical " relationship " outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt people got hurt . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt they cried . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better . 
pos/cv677_17715.txt until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr

pos/cv979_18921.txt let's say you live at the end of an airport runway . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? 
pos/cv979_18921.txt of course you would . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? 
pos/cv979_18921.txt that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt i just sat back and enjoyed myself . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt what makes this film different is its characters . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for " investments " like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt don't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt it's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt instead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt when they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . 
pos/cv979_18921.txt and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .
