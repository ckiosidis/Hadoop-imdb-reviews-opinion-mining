neg/cv581_20790.txt once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt some of these excursions were fun . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i'll explain . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt tommy is really working with the cia . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt knock off sucks . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt it all sounds very cool . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt trust me , it isn't . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt he looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt it's really a test of endurance watching knock off . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt i suppose there's some enjoyment derived from schneider's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film's better moments . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? 
neg/cv581_20790.txt hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt knock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme's others . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much . 
neg/cv581_20790.txt note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 . 


neg/cv092_27987.txt

neg/cv092_27987.txt  " from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt to each it's own however , since " monkey bone " is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena " monkey bone " a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you'll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i'm guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt people are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt when stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can't stand ) he tries to keep him under control . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt when monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or 
neg/cv092_27987.txt something like that . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) " monkey bone " had potential in the script and even the story . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt for instance we really don't get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? 
neg/cv092_27987.txt kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt the cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt dave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as " will & grace's " megan mullally who can be funny . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt the special effects of " monkey bone " is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt some of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for 
neg/cv092_27987.txt monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don't realize that he is animated . . . but 
neg/cv092_27987.txt on occasion it sneaks up on you . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt the direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt it's too bad really , " monkey bone " could have been a real good movie , but with it's heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . 
neg/cv092_27987.txt for those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . 


neg/cv617_9561.txt

neg/cv617_9561.txt by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt in fact , " stale and predictable " describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt instead , stuart places his trust in a " name " star who can't carry the material . 
neg/cv617_9561.txt maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . 


neg/cv456_20370.txt

neg/cv456_20370.txt there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt really , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt with anime , a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two , and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt this is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt vampire hunter d is a gory , gory film . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt if they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it ? s not that it ? s gore is unique - it ? s just like other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc . . . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it really didn ? t . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt one evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here . ) 
neg/cv456_20370.txt of course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt she gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt if it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) 
neg/cv456_20370.txt to fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d ) . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt you see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt when he speaks , it ? s in cliches . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt heroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt in it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt the talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt and that ? s the best defense i can think of . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt why ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt what is the point of that ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt i ? m not a prude , i just don ? t think it ? s warranted . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower ? 
neg/cv456_20370.txt of course not ? it ? s done for shock . 
neg/cv456_20370.txt it ? s tasteless and despicable .

neg/cv812_19051.txt plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a " hard drive " that resides in his head , and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt since he overloaded his " hard drive " , he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark " junkyard " type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever . . . ) , and all the sets look like . . . . well , 
neg/cv812_19051.txt sets . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt there is also absolutely no arc to this story . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt gibson should stick to writing novels and " x-files " episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask ) . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : as of 1999 , director robert longo never directed another full-feature film . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt hmmm . . . now

neg/cv812_19051.txt  : ) writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 , after being rejected for the draft . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt he lived in toronto at first , but since 1972 , has made vancouver his home . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt his 1984 novel " neuromancer " and its sequels 1986's " count zero " and 1988's " mona lisa overdrive " are generally considered to be the definitive works of the " cyberpunk " science-fiction sub-genre . 
neg/cv812_19051.txt this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the " worst actor " category in the 1996 razzie awards . 


neg/cv713_29002.txt

neg/cv713_29002.txt  " america's sweethearts " has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting " comic relief " charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt  " america's sweethearts " takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled " time over time , " are far from rosy . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a " visionary " who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt press junkets are a haven for control freaks . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt the " reporters " are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt when they do deal with journalists , the " it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters " premise is de-clawed . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? 
neg/cv713_29002.txt hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in " america's sweethearts " is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt so what about the cast ? 
neg/cv713_29002.txt julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on " comic relief " - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed " too broad . " 
neg/cv713_29002.txt seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt come to think of it , " little to work with " is the operative phrase for this movie . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt as a hollywood satire , " america's sweethearts " is toothless . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . 
neg/cv713_29002.txt had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been " much ado about nothing . "

neg/cv939_11247.txt post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy's own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt  ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer's friend jennifer aniston . ) 
neg/cv939_11247.txt if only kevin smith could write them all . . . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) 's book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt they are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha's fidelity . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to " test her " . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt the trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt to stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt so hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex . . . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt the script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a " sensitive man " , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt as for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt there are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks " has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? " 
neg/cv939_11247.txt over and over until he's booted off stage . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page . 
neg/cv939_11247.txt kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career , so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back .

neg/cv066_11668.txt mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt jackie chan plays , who else , jackie . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt there are only two scenes of him cooking . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 
neg/cv066_11668.txt a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , 
neg/cv066_11668.txt shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 
neg/cv066_11668.txt anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 
neg/cv066_11668.txt oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? 
neg/cv066_11668.txt watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt the action is a mixed bag here . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt but to slo-mo jackie running ? 
neg/cv066_11668.txt either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . 
neg/cv066_11668.txt however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

neg/cv265_11625.txt a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt he accepts . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the first case given to him is a big test ; a " winless " case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt mary ann is starting to have numerous problems . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt he also starts to lose control of his case . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt that man is his boss , mr . milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt but how do you defeat the devil ? 
neg/cv265_11625.txt why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
neg/cv265_11625.txt do filmmakers really believe that " normal " courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt charlize theron defines the term " over-the-top " in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in " 2 days in the valley " . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
neg/cv265_11625.txt maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt in 1986 i remember watching a movie called " wisdom " with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt what i like to call " guess what , it was all a dream " scenario . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt in " wisdom " the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters " wake up " from an apparent and say " gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! " . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt well , the same thing happens in " the devils advocate " , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt as i recall , " wisdom " was a decent film . 
neg/cv265_11625.txt  " the devil's advocate " is not .

neg/cv813_6649.txt

neg/cv813_6649.txt i am a steven seagal fan . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt i only say this now because " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his " my hands are sharp , nimble knives " thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt he's also put on quite a lot of weight . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? 
neg/cv813_6649.txt  ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that " glimmer man " thing . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt it's the other changes that disappoint . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's " in living colour . " 
neg/cv813_6649.txt wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his " are you crazy " part of the dialogue with wasted zest . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt is that a lot to ask of the seague ? 
neg/cv813_6649.txt too much . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt we trusted him . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt we got to know him . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt now , betrayal . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt i'll try , but it won't be easy . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? 
neg/cv813_6649.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv813_6649.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt see it twice . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . 
neg/cv813_6649.txt everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .
