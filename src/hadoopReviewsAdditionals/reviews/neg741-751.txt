neg/cv287_17410.txt tv's buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in " simply irresistible . " 
neg/cv287_17410.txt sarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt  " simply irresistible " is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt gellar's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public's in her tiny tribeca eatery . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993's mexican classic " like water for chocolate . " 
neg/cv287_17410.txt several differences : one , " like water " didn't have a telekinetic crab , and two , " like water " was a good film . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt  " simply irresistible , " on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it's not like you're were going to miss much . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt but a majority of " simply irresistible " 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there's just no fun rooting for their inevitable " happily ever after . " 
neg/cv287_17410.txt nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it's not going to last long , people . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don't go anywhere either . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt in fact , nothing in " simply irresistible " goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn't go somewhere so much as you wish she'd go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she's the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return . 
neg/cv287_17410.txt it's certainly a dish best not served in it's current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , " simply irresistible " would be strictly unwatchable .

neg/cv527_10338.txt woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt some of these work better than others . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt if that sounds complicated , it is . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt while the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt that story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt allen can do much better than deconstructing harry . 
neg/cv527_10338.txt i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv489_19046.txt

neg/cv489_19046.txt the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt under the " saluting " section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt everyone salutes . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
neg/cv489_19046.txt no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the answer : it looked cool . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt or how about the " atmosphere " ? 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
neg/cv489_19046.txt instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest " yes , sir " s i've ever heard . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , " let's do it again , but this time , i want more . " 
neg/cv489_19046.txt i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt a far cry from his days as linc in " the mod squad " , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt would've been over in a half hour . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt they both seem kind of happy . 
neg/cv489_19046.txt maybe they were driving away from simon west . 


neg/cv425_8603.txt

neg/cv425_8603.txt capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt  ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) 
neg/cv425_8603.txt is jackson's character then simply insane ? 
neg/cv425_8603.txt that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt how did the prosecution get this information ? 
neg/cv425_8603.txt how come he didn't get it ? 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt this is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt it's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt it's all handwaving . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt it's not easy to make a movie about something . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt the other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . 
neg/cv425_8603.txt a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . 


neg/cv643_29282.txt

neg/cv643_29282.txt kids today , they don't just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there's no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a's , where he is hoping for his big break . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt it's only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman's thong ( don't ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! 
neg/cv643_29282.txt  ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn't even bother . . . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt but of course he makes a play for her . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan's non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that '70s show's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it's been done better somewhere else . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt for starters , the film has a major question of identity . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt it's definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt the worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt ryan's catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to " play catch " with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt ryan's stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-'em-tiger-we're-behind-you talk . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? 
neg/cv643_29282.txt don't answer that . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt the only real joy in the film is found in biel's character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt she's the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt when she's on screen , the time flies by . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt when she's not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt for a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? 
neg/cv643_29282.txt for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt or vice versa . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt either way , good luck , jessica . 
neg/cv643_29282.txt as for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze's next " summer catch " is liable to be a venereal disease . 


neg/cv545_12848.txt

neg/cv545_12848.txt this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . 
neg/cv545_12848.txt perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing .

neg/cv797_7245.txt be warned . . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt brit love story in the offing . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo . . . , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much . . . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt personally , give me those cheap laughs any day . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt prentice does though , and that's never explained . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition ) . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt and best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt awwww . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt terrific closure . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt happy ending . 
neg/cv797_7245.txt but just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ?

neg/cv722_7571.txt

neg/cv722_7571.txt the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt tom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you 
neg/cv722_7571.txt get the picture ) don't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : " see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . " 
neg/cv722_7571.txt oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt but wait ! 
neg/cv722_7571.txt there are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! 
neg/cv722_7571.txt and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not " cod " , but " knights of destruction " . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the 
neg/cv722_7571.txt upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! 
neg/cv722_7571.txt so shale does what any good teacher would do . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt ok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it's downright dumb . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? 
neg/cv722_7571.txt and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt but over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt in fact , it reminded me of " miami vice " without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt otherwise , wait for video . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
neg/cv722_7571.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !

neg/cv136_12384.txt seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the big-budget , mega-hype " event " movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt  " lost in space " is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are " resolved " at the right moments . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as " alien " -lite . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt  " lost in space " is major film production at its worst . 
neg/cv136_12384.txt it's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .

neg/cv692_17026.txt attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt the film will work just as well as a silent movie . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt chronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt there isn't one of these characters worth caring about . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of " people magazine . " 
neg/cv692_17026.txt among others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt and unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt it's new year's eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt monica's apartment is in " noho , " an area that one of the guests describes as " so cool , all of the poor people live there . " 
neg/cv692_17026.txt typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year's eve birthday . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt  " cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , " kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt another character , played by jay mohr , has a problem with his sexual triumphs . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him , his response is " i like a lot of people . " 
neg/cv692_17026.txt as the movie finally draws to a close , the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little , while others actually have some clue as to what happened . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot , all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind , which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt 200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 . 
neg/cv692_17026.txt it is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers .
