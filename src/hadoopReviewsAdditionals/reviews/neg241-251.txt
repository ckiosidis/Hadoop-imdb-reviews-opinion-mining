neg/cv495_16121.txt in the finale of disney's " mighty joe young , " a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt upon impact , rugged everyman and perennial do-gooder bill paxton rushes in , containing the emotional crowd with an earnest " move along now folks , there's nothing to see here . " 
neg/cv495_16121.txt ok , so those aren't exactly the words he uses , but it's probably one of the few clich ? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies , " king kong . " 
neg/cv495_16121.txt 1949's " mighty joe young " was an update of that classic creature feature , also based on merian c . cooper's original story ( 16 years after " 'kong " it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable ) . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt now some 49 years later , at least according to disney's way of thinking , the world is ready for one more . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt not so . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt the only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt and these , unfortunately , run hot and cold . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt today's joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker , who has been wowing audiences with his state-of-the-art make-up effects since 1971's " schlock " ( which , incidentally , featured a baker-enhanced " gorilla " ) . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt joe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt while there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker's had a lot of practice with simian effects , after all , including " gorillas in the mist , " " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes , " and the 1976 remake of " king kong " --there's also some surprising cheesiness . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt one of the film's most embarrassing moments is when paxton's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from " the lost world : jurassic park " ) . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt paxton jubilantly extols the beast's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt also , if the film's producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn't have paraded female lead charlize theron ( " trial & error " ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrobe of spaghetti-strapped tops . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt even joe seems distracted at times . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt the film piles on the clich ? s like there's no tomorrow , including the predictable plot ( anthro-zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l . a . where urban havoc is inevitably wrought ) , predictable villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace ) , predictable love story ( bill and charlize--surprise ! ) , and predictable denouement ( " 'twas box-office receipts that killed the beast " ) . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt kids raised on " men in black " ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( " tremors " ) underwood's outing a little lame by comparison . 
neg/cv495_16121.txt while certainly better than 1978's " king kong lives " ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , " mighty joe young " proves how the mighty keep falling .

neg/cv311_17708.txt drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt she has perfected these characters in movies such as " the wedding singer " and , most notably , " ever after . " 
neg/cv311_17708.txt now she's back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - " never been kissed . " 
neg/cv311_17708.txt you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don't mean steve ) invented the printing press . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt the premise is simple . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt barrymore's josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens are feeling and doing . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt josie ( she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt these are among the many problems that plague " never been kissed . " 
neg/cv311_17708.txt screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school's most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt ok , so " never been kissed " is not a sociological expose of today's high school scene . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say " get me rewrite . " 
neg/cv311_17708.txt to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt  " never been kissed " is entertaining and funny in fits and starts . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt the movie's main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt real mature . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt and that is the main deficiency with " never been kissed . " 
neg/cv311_17708.txt it's illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding . 
neg/cv311_17708.txt it has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles .

neg/cv142_23657.txt deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) cleans fish tanks . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt yeah , i didn't know that was a real job either . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt one of his customers is antoine leconte ( oded fehr ) , a successful gigolo . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks , he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing $800 fish . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt fooling around , deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a $6000 fish tank . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt after taking a try at one of antoine's clients and earning $10 , deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fiery-tempered antoine returns . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt enter t . j . ( eddie griffin ) , a pimp for " man-whores , " who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt there's an enormous woman ( played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue ) who hides food in her clothes . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt there's claire ( gail o'grady ) whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt tina ( torsten voges ) is so tall her face doesn't fit on the screen , and ruth ( amy poehler ) has tourette's syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt finally there's kate ( arija bareikis ) whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt she seems perfect , and deuce quickly falls in love with her . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt  ( she does , we discover later , have an imperfection , but deuce decides it isn't important . ) 
neg/cv142_23657.txt deuce's life is complicated by a bothersome cop ( william forsythe ) looking for information on antoine and by kate's discovery of his man-whoring . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt however , neither threat generates much suspense . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt  " deuce bigalow " is the first project from adam sandler's company happy madison , the formation of which assures that we'll be seeing the sandler style of comedy mass-produced at an increasing rate in years to come . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt be afraid . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt be very afraid . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt the good news is that sandler doesn't actually appear in " deuce " and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted deuce believable . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt griffin's delivery is dead-on , especially in the coining of " technical terms " for t . j . 's profession , as in " don't make me he-bitch man-slap you ! " 
neg/cv142_23657.txt there's the expected amount of toilet humor in " deuce . " 
neg/cv142_23657.txt  ( for one thing , deuce's dad is a men's room attendant ) . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ? 
neg/cv142_23657.txt for most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed . 
neg/cv142_23657.txt bottom line : " deuce " doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently funny . 


neg/cv499_11407.txt

neg/cv499_11407.txt the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt or even -- god help me -- palmetto . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt i screamed , too , " get me out of this theater ! " 
neg/cv499_11407.txt new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the movie starts out oh-so-promising . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt all well and good , right ? 
neg/cv499_11407.txt wrong . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt  ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . ) 
neg/cv499_11407.txt so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt >from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt we're given a hero who can " tune " into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 
neg/cv499_11407.txt usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part " isn't given much to do . " 
neg/cv499_11407.txt in this movie , no one is given anything to do . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt um . . . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt a man who doesn't remember anything . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic . 
neg/cv499_11407.txt it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere . 


neg/cv402_16097.txt

neg/cv402_16097.txt in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt whichever one you like , dear , he says . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt i liked that scene for two reasons . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt first , the cakes looked really cool . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt  ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) 
neg/cv402_16097.txt it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt it's as if someone told pitt , " never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . " 
neg/cv402_16097.txt it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt i've used the phrase " angel of death " in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt  ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . ) 
neg/cv402_16097.txt hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . 
neg/cv402_16097.txt don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

neg/cv654_19345.txt you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt these people had what are known as " conspiracy theories " - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt a little imagination goes a long way . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation " conspiracy theory " newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt part of this is a result of the film's slow pace . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite " black elements " : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt big deal , we've seen it all before . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt now , when i say it took forever to set up the " relationship " between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt you know what happens then ? 
neg/cv654_19345.txt nothing , zip , nada . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? 
neg/cv654_19345.txt okay , here's another one . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel " the catcher in the rye " . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt jerry also has a bunch of copies . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt the point becomes totally extraneous . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? 
neg/cv654_19345.txt yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt that's about it . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt okay , here's my theory . 
neg/cv654_19345.txt this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! 
neg/cv654_19345.txt the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . 


neg/cv770_11061.txt

neg/cv770_11061.txt in french , the phrase " film noir " literally means " black film . " 
neg/cv770_11061.txt webster defines it as " a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music . " 
neg/cv770_11061.txt classic film noir , including such memorable fare as " the big sleep , " the original " cape fear , " and orson welles' striking " a touch of evil , " employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt color came into play with neo-noir films like " chinatown " and " blade runner . " 
neg/cv770_11061.txt  " l . a . confidential , " easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's " palmetto . " 
neg/cv770_11061.txt based on " just another sucker , " a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , " palmetto " shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt director volker schlondorff ( " tin drum , " the handmaid's tale " ) stated " we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy . " 
neg/cv770_11061.txt it shows . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt  " palmetto " is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a " reward " for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt no problem , though . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt rhea needs " a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom " for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny . ) 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar " ransom " from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt things go wrong , of course . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d . a . 's 
neg/cv770_11061.txt office . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr . despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the officer wants to help change harry's flat tire and asks him to open the trunk . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff's grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt the film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt we're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt had " palmetto " been played with tongue firmly in cheek , it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt but under the harsh direction of schlondorff , the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo- noir cluelessness . 
neg/cv770_11061.txt avoid this nonsense and go see " l . a . confidential " instead . 


neg/cv630_10152.txt

neg/cv630_10152.txt when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , " i knew love would keep us together , " since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt there are some seriously stupid things in this movie . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the " inner winds " , generated by earth's magma flows . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt how fast ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt as katana says , " you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . " 
neg/cv630_10152.txt what ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn " red " williams , otherwise known as " saber " on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt how do we know this is where she went ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt there's a lot of major flipping action , too . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt do they land and immediately get into the fighting ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt do they collide in mid-air ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt why did they need those metal balls to travel ? 
neg/cv630_10152.txt everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt  " ouch " was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt it seems that's all there is in this movie . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt maybe it is . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt as i had mentioned , the acting is bad . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , " you look good in mud . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt no , really , you do . " 
neg/cv630_10152.txt remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids . 
neg/cv630_10152.txt hey , just like the video game ! 


neg/cv986_15092.txt

neg/cv986_15092.txt there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical " naked gun " films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's committed himself to starring in since . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt the wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt to be fair , " wrongfully accused , " the send-up in question and nielsen's third parody since the last " gun , " isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his " dracula : dead and loving it " or " spy hard , " which is a mighty good thing . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt nielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt  " wrongfully accused " meshes together the premises of " the fugitive " and " patriot games , " casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt she , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt harrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones' already smirky oscar-winning role ) . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt there's also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt  " wrongfully accused " gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted " lord of the violin " by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt nice touch . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt  ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and " baywatch " goofs . ) 
neg/cv986_15092.txt movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la " anaconda " or baseball players disappear into a " field of dreams " -esque cornfield , there's really nothing to laugh at . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt other moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt and what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those " naked gun " s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember " wrongfully accused " as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . 
neg/cv986_15092.txt the movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of " mafia ! " , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and " baseketball , " from proft colleague david zucker , but it's a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing " wrongfully accused " of being nielsen's funniest .

neg/cv632_9704.txt guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt but i know so well that it's a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt a simple , white on black title card reads " starship troopers " -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? 
neg/cv632_9704.txt were the rest of the film that subdued . . . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt  ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future . ) 
neg/cv632_9704.txt one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt hysterically funny , actually . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt the politics of the film are scary . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i've encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt of course , verhoeven's probably the one to blame , and perhaps i'm jealous because i'm so disgusting . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt at any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn't be about sex . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt exactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt and r-rated , despite its goofy premise . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt maybe it's asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he's a master of insipid violence . 
neg/cv632_9704.txt however , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .
