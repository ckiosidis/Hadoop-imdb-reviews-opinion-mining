pos/cv205_9457.txt when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought " what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? " . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied " not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now " . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . 
pos/cv205_9457.txt i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .

pos/cv473_7367.txt the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt how wrong they were . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt the story is about martians attacking earth . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt using ray guns ( hooray ! ) 
pos/cv473_7367.txt they generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt but , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt the way people are killed by the ray guns is great , they is a hillarous ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt but , most of all , this film is fun . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt the martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt the film is a million times better then the dire independance day , and is a real tribute to the tacky '50s invasion movies . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt they are is a great score by danny elfman , and lots of laughs . 
pos/cv473_7367.txt this has to be the best invasion i've seen for a long time . 


pos/cv919_16380.txt

pos/cv919_16380.txt when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called " the postman , " i thought , " an american version of 'il postino ? ' 
pos/cv919_16380.txt starring costner ? 
pos/cv919_16380.txt god help us ! " 
pos/cv919_16380.txt when i found out that it was not a remake of " postino " but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , " 'landworld ? ' 
pos/cv919_16380.txt please , god , make him stop ! " 
pos/cv919_16380.txt as it turns out , " the postman " is a much better film than i had expected . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt despite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt the setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt costner's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt taking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of " the restored united states . " 
pos/cv919_16380.txt he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt one young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt ford spreads the postman's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt as war breaks out between bethlehem's army and the postal workers , costner's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt his lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt  " postman " is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of " sergio leone meets frank capra " ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt what could have been another knock-off of " the road warrior " ( like " waterworld " was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt tate is the stand-out in the movie's large cast . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt ford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate's character in his debut film , " menace ii society " ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog's cynicism and brutality . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt his performance sells the movie . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt interestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman's love interest , abby . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt when they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt predictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt however , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt  " the postman " is costner's best work thus far . 
pos/cv919_16380.txt perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future .

pos/cv843_15544.txt the small-scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt filled with breathtaking scenery , 'characters' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt the village consists of several amusing characters . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt there's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt pacing is right . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we've been interested in the goings on . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt in one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt one of the key moments in the film . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt a fine film that's for everybody except action fans . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt somewhat like 'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . . 
pos/cv843_15544.txt but livelier . 


pos/cv601_23453.txt

pos/cv601_23453.txt i rented " brokedown palace " last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt that is no easy task . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably " return to paradise " and " midnight express . " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt as a result nearly every review of " brokedown palace " i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was " midnight express " ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of " return to paradise . " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , " lord jim . " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world " justice " system . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt by now alarm bells are going off among viewers . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer " yankee hank " ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , " who do you trust ? , " and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
pos/cv601_23453.txt with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt if " brokedown palace " has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt and , if that were all there was to " brokedown palace , " it wouldn't be a very good movie . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt whereas darlene's life is " on-track , " aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and " fulfillment , " alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt tellingly , alice is present but not included . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while " dar " remains seated in the shade . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt  " brokedown palace " begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt however unintentional , it's all alice's fault . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt  ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) 
pos/cv601_23453.txt dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt dar is innocent . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt it doesn't matter . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt alice is the subject of this movie . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt she and her journey toward personal freedom . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt in the end , that culture , like its representatives , " yankee " hank and dar's father ( a " man who knows how to grease the wheels " ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and " hard manual labor " consisted of picking grass ! 
pos/cv601_23453.txt the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt 'freedom' has many faces and " brokedown palace " explores many of them . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt but freedom seldom comes without a price . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt which is why the movie's other tag lines are : " what is your dream ? " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt and " how far would you go ? " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt kate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the " released " temple bird referred to twice during the film , " trained to fly back to its cage . " 
pos/cv601_23453.txt as the thai magistrate observed in the film's climactic scene , the issue was always one of " character ; " and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that " freedom " is achieved within oneself . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? 
pos/cv601_23453.txt increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt in reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt think about that . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? 
pos/cv601_23453.txt do yourself a favor : rent " brokedown palace " and watch it with a open mind . 
pos/cv601_23453.txt there's more there than meets the eye . 


pos/cv935_23841.txt

pos/cv935_23841.txt when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt then it was going to be " you too can believe pastel triangles can fly " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt then , it was going to be " you too can believe wood sprites can fly " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
pos/cv935_23841.txt as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt is the format effective for the film ? 
pos/cv935_23841.txt with a few exceptions , yes . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's " the pines of rome " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the " oceans " of clouds . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt absolutely beautiful stuff . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's " rhapsody in blue " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's " piano concerto no . 2 " and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's " the steadfast tin soldier " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , " the steadfast tin soldier " is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt segment five is the funniest of the bunch . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt set to camille saint-saens " the carnival of the animals " , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , " the sorcerer's apprentice " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's " pomp and circumstance march no . 1 " and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt donald duck " stars " as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt powerful stuff . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? " saving the best for last " . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt set to igor stravinsky's " the firebird " , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's " ride of the valkyries " , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . 
pos/cv935_23841.txt then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .

pos/cv531_26486.txt

pos/cv531_26486.txt an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt he shows her as a human being . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt the only support and hope is in god . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt god is no longer her support . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt he has become her obsession . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt but the film is far from being flawless . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt the script needs a lot of polishing . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt except for jeanne , there are no real characters . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the " three musketeers " of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt 'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? 
pos/cv531_26486.txt or was she truly a messenger of god ? 
pos/cv531_26486.txt the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt bess o messenger' is nothing more than a fairly good film . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . 
pos/cv531_26486.txt it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it's on the battlefield . 


pos/cv313_18198.txt

pos/cv313_18198.txt matthew broderick and high school comedy . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt but election is far different . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , " super nice " young girl . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt so paul agrees and the race is on . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt well , " i don't even want to go to college , " she says . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt in election , there are no " good guys " . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt almost everyone has their own agenda . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt she is the girl that would be labeled " most likely to achieve anything she wants " in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . 
pos/cv313_18198.txt there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here . 


pos/cv294_11684.txt

pos/cv294_11684.txt since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . " 
pos/cv294_11684.txt  " the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt  " lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . " 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . " 
pos/cv294_11684.txt deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt if " fargo " was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light . 
pos/cv294_11684.txt the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . 


pos/cv515_17069.txt

pos/cv515_17069.txt not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . 
pos/cv515_17069.txt the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .
