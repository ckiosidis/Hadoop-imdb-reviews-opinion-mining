neg/cv154_9562.txt the ads for " batman and robin " scream " the event of the summer is here " and that's the problem . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt  " batman and robin " is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt it wasn't always this way . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt tim burton's " batman " was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt  " batman and robin " has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the blame lies with director joel schumacher . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt  " batman and robin " is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt  " batman and robin " doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt ironically , the parts of " batman and robin " that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where " batman and robin " really suffers . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt the biggest lesson to be learned from " batman and robin " is that more is not better . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt i don't think so . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt my prescription ? 
neg/cv154_9562.txt fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . 
neg/cv154_9562.txt then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the " event " mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time .

neg/cv244_22935.txt ewan mcgregor - codename : " eye " - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt maybe there's a really good reason for it . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt there's some genuine talent involved here .

neg/cv244_22935.txt eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
neg/cv244_22935.txt national spy ring ? 
neg/cv244_22935.txt private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt he has received his assignment from k . d . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims " merry christmas , dad ! "

neg/cv244_22935.txt so begins our tale of obsession . . . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt or . . . something . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt and that's precisely where this film fails . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt this is the kind of movie that pisses me off . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt here , the filmmakers have confused " surreal " and " deep " with " vaguely unclear " and " crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . " 
neg/cv244_22935.txt i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in " love " with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : " beauty is in the eye of the beholder . " 
neg/cv244_22935.txt whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt that's as deep as it gets , folks . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .

neg/cv244_22935.txt iguana comes into focus . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt wow , man . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . 
neg/cv244_22935.txt someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , " shut the hell up ! " , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen . 


neg/cv011_13044.txt

neg/cv011_13044.txt janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . " 
neg/cv011_13044.txt it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt that's how it works in movies like these . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt what the message here ? 
neg/cv011_13044.txt sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . 
neg/cv011_13044.txt both of them should have known better . 


neg/cv427_11693.txt

neg/cv427_11693.txt  " mandingo " has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , " a trashy potboiler " that " appeals only to the s&m crowd . " 
neg/cv427_11693.txt actually , i think " mandingo " is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his " bed wench , " the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had " pleasured " her before he did . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a " white lady , " had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt judging only by the plot , " mandingo " is pure sexploitation . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt when " mandingo " was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt dramatically , " mandingo " is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but " mandingo's " overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt some tried to write off " mandingo " as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt  " mandingo " was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as " the bible " ( 1966 ) , the remake of " king kong " ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated " dune " ( 1984 ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " ( 1954 ) and " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as " the narrow margin " ( 1952 ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on " serpico . " 
neg/cv427_11693.txt james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt so why is " mandingo " so bad ? 
neg/cv427_11693.txt a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( " yessuh , massuh " ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( " fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? " ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( " if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! " ) . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt despite its exploitative nature , " mandingo " was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt even classics such as " gone with the wind " ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt  " mandingo " reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt with a little more maturity and different handling , " mandingo " might have been an effective , worthwhile film . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but " mandingo " never does it . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt steven spielberg touched on that same topic in " schindler's list " ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt the difference between that film and " mandingo " is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . 
neg/cv427_11693.txt  " mandingo " is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its " trashy potboiler " nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished .

neg/cv562_10847.txt just say it has very high explosive potential . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt what is the target of these thieves ? 
neg/cv562_10847.txt why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something 
neg/cv562_10847.txt ancient and deadly . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt and now the creature senses fresh meat ! 
neg/cv562_10847.txt so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt and the monster gets to pick them off one by one . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt  ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) 
neg/cv562_10847.txt treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt they all had a set of " rules " about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules . . . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt or if it does , not a very good one . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt it simply happens . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt unfortunately , deep rising's efforts are more on par with speed 2 . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt on the plus side , however , the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . 
neg/cv562_10847.txt perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one . 


neg/cv851_21895.txt

neg/cv851_21895.txt don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as " the conscience " ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema . 
neg/cv851_21895.txt compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .

neg/cv837_27232.txt a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt when verlaine states , " poets can learn from one another , " rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , " only if they're bad poets . " 
neg/cv837_27232.txt he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt the film ends on a whimper . . . with 
neg/cv837_27232.txt verlaine talking with rimbaud's sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work . 
neg/cv837_27232.txt it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry .

neg/cv216_20165.txt as far as " mystery men " is concerned , the burning question is less " is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer ? " 
neg/cv216_20165.txt  ( the answer there is an unequivocal " yes " ) and more " how in the name of sweet jesus did first-time director kinka usher get such a first-rate cast to act in this muck ? " 
neg/cv216_20165.txt  " mystery men " features greg kinnear as the heavily-sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis ( singular ) casanova frankenstein . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title , who join forces to get c . amazing out of a tight spot when c . frankenstein puts the screws on champion city . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt there's william h . macy as the mild-mannered shoveler , hank azaria as the cutlery-flinging blue raja ( no knives , but a phony english accent that's just as sharp ) , ben stiller as mr . furious ( whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar ) , janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her father's skull interestingly preserved , wes studi as a rhetoric-spouting cowled avenger , and kel mitchell as the token ( and , adding insult to injury , invisible ! ) 
neg/cv216_20165.txt black guy . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt bringing up the rear , so to speak , is paul reubens ( yes , that's pee wee herman paul reubens ) as . . . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt well , let's just call him the gas man . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt the production design is overblown , the special effects are overdone , and the script ( based on bob burden's " dark horse " comic book series ) is overbaked . 
neg/cv216_20165.txt the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar , but they can't begin to save " mystery men " --it's just one big mess .

neg/cv922_10185.txt stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt this film should be brilliant . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt however , it can't hold up . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded 
neg/cv922_10185.txt some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt in this film , serious means dull . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt in fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt however , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt however , it's not all that bad . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt as said above , the action scenes are well done . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt theres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt in fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt cop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . 
neg/cv922_10185.txt hugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . 


neg/cv639_10797.txt

neg/cv639_10797.txt i'll be the first to admit it . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , " i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i'll 
neg/cv639_10797.txt gonna tell it the way i remember it . " 
neg/cv639_10797.txt anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt ok . . . maybe 
neg/cv639_10797.txt that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt and then the plot moves on . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt enter miss havisham . . . or 
neg/cv639_10797.txt ms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt you wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt in fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt finn's relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt what's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt although it's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt some of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt finn's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt we never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt as a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt modernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare's romeo+juliet ) . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt simply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . 
neg/cv639_10797.txt as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .
