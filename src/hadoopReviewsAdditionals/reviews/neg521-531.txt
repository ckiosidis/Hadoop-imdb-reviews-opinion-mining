neg/cv948_25870.txt and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners , not rating anything lower than your standard " this movie sucks " , along comes this cinematic atrocity and he's forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick , even the bravest movie-goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt yes , despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie , the latest highlander doesn't seem to have anything going for it . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt oh stinky movie , let me count thee ways . . . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt plot : ( from what i understood ) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal . . . or 
neg/cv948_25870.txt something along those lines . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt critique : a complete and utter mess . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt disjointed , incoherent , boring , corny , filled with bad dialogue . . . and 
neg/cv948_25870.txt that's just the first thirty minutes ! 
neg/cv948_25870.txt this film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt it's confusing to anyone who doesn't know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group ) . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt the film doesn't explain anything about itself . . . it 
neg/cv948_25870.txt just goes from one inexplicable situation to another . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt one moment they're in the present time , the next moment , they're in italy in the 1600s . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt why ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt who knows . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt what are they talking about ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt no idea . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt flashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! 
neg/cv948_25870.txt hullo . . . ? ! ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt confused yet ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt random swordplay , mad max-like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt or were they in the present at that time ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt who knows . . . and to be honest . . . who 
neg/cv948_25870.txt seriously cares ! 
neg/cv948_25870.txt this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt please , please . . . for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie-making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! 
neg/cv948_25870.txt even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action , some fast-motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt and is there anything spectacular about the sword-play or fight scenes ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt nope . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close-ups . . . yipes , 
neg/cv948_25870.txt the man is not aging gracefully , is he ? 
neg/cv948_25870.txt oh boy , and i haven't even gotten around to the greatest piece of over-acting that i've seen in years . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt the man who plays kell in this movie , bruce payne , should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt overacting is not a hobby for this guy . . . it's 
neg/cv948_25870.txt a living ! 
neg/cv948_25870.txt he's also very funny , not purposely though . 
neg/cv948_25870.txt all in all , the movie stinks .

neg/cv104_19176.txt this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt yes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . 
neg/cv104_19176.txt it's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers .

neg/cv409_29625.txt capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt this is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt  , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
neg/cv409_29625.txt jalla ! jalla ! 
neg/cv409_29625.txt is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt roro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt roro ( nicknamed " jalla " ) is having family problems . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt yasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt the plot turns in several places are contrived . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt when things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt we do see some of roro's family life and his concerns . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt while the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this . 
neg/cv409_29625.txt i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


neg/cv422_9632.txt

neg/cv422_9632.txt  " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt it wasn't the worst film of year by any means . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! 
neg/cv422_9632.txt even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt  . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt  . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt well , annoyingly unprofessional . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt but the main problem i found with " spawn " , as with most films that wind up on my " worst of " lists , is that it was just plain boring . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt who knows if " spawn : the video game " wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ? 
neg/cv422_9632.txt keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing . 
neg/cv422_9632.txt if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be ! 
neg/cv422_9632.txt trust me ! 
neg/cv422_9632.txt  " spawn " has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers ! 


neg/cv343_10906.txt

neg/cv343_10906.txt deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 
neg/cv343_10906.txt capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . 
neg/cv343_10906.txt  ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . ) 
neg/cv343_10906.txt as the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . 
neg/cv343_10906.txt the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series . 
neg/cv343_10906.txt take your kids to see boogie nights instead . 


neg/cv603_18885.txt

neg/cv603_18885.txt i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby ! 
neg/cv603_18885.txt no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt even the special effects seem rather bland . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the 
neg/cv603_18885.txt acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours . 
neg/cv603_18885.txt pm is one long headache . 


neg/cv634_11989.txt

neg/cv634_11989.txt i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the first half of the movie succeeds on most points . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ? 
neg/cv634_11989.txt after all , what's so great about being an angel ? 
neg/cv634_11989.txt sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? 
neg/cv634_11989.txt and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt i could go on longer , but i don't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt city of angels , then , is a paradox . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . 
neg/cv634_11989.txt all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . 


neg/cv064_25842.txt

neg/cv064_25842.txt rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt running time : 117 minutes 
neg/cv064_25842.txt directed by : christian duguay 
neg/cv064_25842.txt i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's " blade " . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt i walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock " the matrix " , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt christian duguay's direction is also not that great . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt even the whole " matrix " ending wasn't even good . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt so for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt it's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . 
neg/cv064_25842.txt if you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " , it isn't a great film either , but at least it's better than this .

neg/cv149_17084.txt when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it got great reviews . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead-on parody of mob movies " . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? 
neg/cv149_17084.txt well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt  " analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the " naked gun " series , he probably would have been a lot more successful . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt this doesn't work . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt and the movie is badly paced , too . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it never takes off . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt i think the blame for this should be placed on the script . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt if " analyze this " had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt i would have been too busy laughing to notice . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt but as it is , i only chuckled a few times . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of " the godfather " . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt i loathed " there's something about mary " , yet loved " baseketball " . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see " office space " . 
neg/cv149_17084.txt it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as " analyze this " did .

neg/cv879_16585.txt  " return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 . " 
neg/cv879_16585.txt on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind-the-scenes " look at an exploitation film being made . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt but other than that two-minute distraction , " return to horror high , " is certainly no great shake . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . 
neg/cv879_16585.txt and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally .
