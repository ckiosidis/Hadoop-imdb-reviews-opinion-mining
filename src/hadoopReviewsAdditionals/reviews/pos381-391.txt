pos/cv128_29627.txt capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt  , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv128_29627.txt mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt a wealthy family is having a wedding . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt the latter will , however , help with an international release . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . 
pos/cv128_29627.txt i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

pos/cv705_11059.txt mary norton's children's book series , the borrowers , has been made into several below-average television movies . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt so , i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt their aunt , who owned the property , never left a will . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt now , an unscrupulous lawyer , ocious potter ( john goodman ) plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra-modern housing development . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt but the lenders are not alone in their house . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers , 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human " beans " above . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders , especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt so it is up to the clocks ( pod ( jim broadbent ) and homily ( celia imrie ) , along with their kids , arrietty ( flora newbigin ) and peagreen ( tom felton ) ) to recover the will and save the household . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt but when potter learns of the tiny people , he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff ( mark williams ) to kill off the clan . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt there's plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt based on an original story , the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt as the villain , john goodman's performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt but his performance suits the role well , and he does very well in the film's many slapstick moments . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are very well done . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief . 
pos/cv705_11059.txt hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch .

pos/cv634_11101.txt if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? 
pos/cv634_11101.txt  " gattaca " is a film which presents a future where society has answered " yes " to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt  " gattaca " came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future " gattaca " presents becomes true . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt contrary to the misleading trailers , " gattaca " is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel " brave new world " featured genetically engineered children ) . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what " gattaca " presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( " wings " ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : " men in black , " " a life less ordinary " . . . ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt since vincent looks a bit like him . . . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt  " gattaca " warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we'll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . 
pos/cv634_11101.txt and when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out .

pos/cv737_28907.txt a . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies . 
pos/cv737_28907.txt it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances . 
pos/cv737_28907.txt the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children . 
pos/cv737_28907.txt and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution . 
pos/cv737_28907.txt a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love .

pos/cv737_28907.txt the first third of a . i .

pos/cv737_28907.txt he is abandoned and alone . 
pos/cv737_28907.txt david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him .

pos/cv762_13927.txt what is freedom ? 
pos/cv762_13927.txt how does one determine who is free ? 
pos/cv762_13927.txt in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama " amistad " is about . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard " la amistad " . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the two spaniards who own " la amistad " want the slaves for themselves . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the american ship that found the slaves also wants them . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the film itself is a visual wonder . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt it is this emotional force that carries the film . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the movie , however , belongs to hounsou . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt his emotional intensity is brilliant . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt but that doesn't matter . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . 
pos/cv762_13927.txt a good job all around .

pos/cv022_12864.txt 1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big " breakthrough " role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt and to my surprise , it grew on me . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's " somebody to love " , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . 
pos/cv022_12864.txt or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . ) 
pos/cv022_12864.txt hell , that's what i do every day . 


pos/cv913_29252.txt

pos/cv913_29252.txt before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! 
pos/cv913_29252.txt if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some " time off " at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt the two do not like each other . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt one night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt he actually plays a " macho " guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly " sick of seeing " in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt i didn't care much for her running joke about him " dying " whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , 
pos/cv913_29252.txt yum ! 
pos/cv913_29252.txt harumph , but i digress . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt so let's recap . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt i can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt it's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , " old-school " kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . 
pos/cv913_29252.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you've got mail ( 4/10 ) 


pos/cv501_11657.txt

pos/cv501_11657.txt as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : " if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! " 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  " campbell gives a stunning performance ! " 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  " this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! " 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
pos/cv501_11657.txt now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt trouble is , i have already seen it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and i like it ! 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the style in which it is filmed is rich in color . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
pos/cv501_11657.txt when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt we can turn off our brains , right ? 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wrong . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt he's heading the class discussion . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex . . . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  " what is a sex crime ? " 
pos/cv501_11657.txt ray asks . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt  " not gettin' any ! " 
pos/cv501_11657.txt one student responds . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and so , wild things sets into motion . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt this is pretty much just one trashy film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's good trash , in a sense . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's not as graphic as you might think ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt what first made me want to see wild things was its cast . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt you can tell she will be around for a long time . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt towards the end she does get a bigger part . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and then there is bill murray . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt his direction is smooth and stylish . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt then , there is the music . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's wonderfully composed and presented . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! 
pos/cv501_11657.txt mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it's an entertaining way to finish the film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let's face it--people want to see it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt so why not give it to them ? 
pos/cv501_11657.txt neve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that's who should see it . 
pos/cv501_11657.txt it's definitely not for those under 18 ! 
pos/cv501_11657.txt did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . 


pos/cv493_12839.txt

pos/cv493_12839.txt one of kyle mclachlan's earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt plot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an " entity " from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this " thing " before it's too late . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt critique : this fast-paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock 'n roll attitude . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt then again , how can you go wrong with an " alien " that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! 
pos/cv493_12839.txt granted , the plot isn't the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt i wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa'd nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt have a blast ! ! 
pos/cv493_12839.txt two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt the opening sequence is one of the most rockin' scenes to open any action movie , and the subsequent extra-terrestrial " transformation " is another eye-catcher . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt even the late 80's special effects were okay . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt followed by the hidden ii in 1994 . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt little known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan's first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films . 
pos/cv493_12839.txt his first two movie appearances were in lynch's wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 )
