pos/cv153_10779.txt jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt he's mean . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt i mean really mean . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt this is that little dog . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . 
pos/cv153_10779.txt award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie .

pos/cv899_16014.txt the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard's materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt indeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt including this year's upcoming a midsummer night's dream , shakespeare's material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt but for a change of pace , mrs . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt marc norman and tom stoppard's story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt  ( will shakespeare of the 1590's would've been married to anne hathaway , and he would've had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- " romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter " -- just doesn't quite seem right . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , " romeo and juliet . " 
pos/cv899_16014.txt the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt the supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will's worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt even ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt the story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the " let's make a movie " -genre . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience's lowest common denominator . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt there's something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt although certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998's pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . 
pos/cv899_16014.txt certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year's-open releases is just around the corner . 


pos/cv513_6923.txt

pos/cv513_6923.txt when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been " updated " i shuddered . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt i thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt fortunately , i was wrong . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt baz luhrman has directed an " in your face " , and visually stunning piece with this film . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt it revolves around the two rival families , who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt these rival companies/families are the capulet's and the montague's . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs , who despise one another . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt as the storylines goes , romeo montague ( played by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( claire danes ) meet at a fancy dress party , and it is love at first site . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film , the scene in which romeo's eyes meet juliet's through the fish tank is one of the most memorable . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt of course , they cannot publicly reveal their love , for their families are arch enemies . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt so they marry in secret , this is where things begin to go wrong . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt the story , as with all good shakespeare , ends in tragedy . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt the cinematography is spectacular to say the least , and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to " lay our scene " , as the film says . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt there is very little to criticise . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt the performances are convincing , and several of the film's younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever . 
pos/cv513_6923.txt despite the well known storyline , this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience ( especially the younger generation ) , and this is certainly a great credit to the film . 


pos/cv188_19226.txt

pos/cv188_19226.txt synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt disco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in fact , they're terrified . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt as in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt the cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt no one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt all around new york people are different . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt vinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt ritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt everyone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as " alien " to the community . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt unfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt opinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt it's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in other movies sex is glamorized . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt for example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt or boring made-for-video " suspense " movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt not so with summer of sam . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt sex is there , but it isn't gratuitous or titillating . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt sex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of " difference " breeding hostility . 
pos/cv188_19226.txt in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking .

pos/cv220_29059.txt a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel " arkham asylum " , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a " valentine " just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so " high concept " that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's " caveman " a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt with a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with " gotham pd . " 
pos/cv220_29059.txt that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt whether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt it , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal " the dark knight returns " , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt readers of sam keith's brilliant " the maxx " comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt the failure of both " the maxx " tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt _the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . 
pos/cv220_29059.txt _the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland . 


pos/cv328_10373.txt

pos/cv328_10373.txt do film critics have morals ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal " grudge " against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt can't be that good ) . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt make sense ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt ok , but what about comparing ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt i think it is , and i'll tell you why . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt a good critic should be able to view the film from the " average joe ( or jane ) " viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt sometimes that can be tough . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt  " the acting was superb , but i was bored " or " i loved it ! ! 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it was sooooo cheezy ! " 
pos/cv328_10373.txt might be used to describe a film . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt but which is more important ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt and which is better ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask " how does it compare to pulp fiction ? " 
pos/cv328_10373.txt and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt jackie brown stars pam grier , the " blaxploitation " heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt  ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt also involved is ordell's " surfer girl " girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt in fact , maybe a new face would have been better . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel " rum punch " . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . 
pos/cv328_10373.txt after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .

pos/cv263_19259.txt american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to " lose it " by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt all women are there to be ogled . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt  ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . ) 
pos/cv263_19259.txt situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt  ( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt to amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . ) 
pos/cv263_19259.txt what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt two more standouts : klein and " sctv " 's eugene levy . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne's underappreciated election . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt levy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds' " don't you ( forget about me ) . " 
pos/cv263_19259.txt the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie's protagonists first whip out a condom . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt as far as the new teen cinema goes , it's at the top of the heap . 
pos/cv263_19259.txt  * don't say i didn't warn you about the party scene . 


pos/cv731_4136.txt

pos/cv731_4136.txt  ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) 
pos/cv731_4136.txt seven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt for starters , classifying seven as a " thriller " would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an " intense drama , " because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as " simple " as a corpse . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects ) . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt in addition to style , fincher supplies substance . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt its easy to see why . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt the world doesn't make sense . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt  ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) 
pos/cv731_4136.txt why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and " picking up the pieces " he will be able to catch the killer ? 
pos/cv731_4136.txt somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt however , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt but if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a " psycho , " with no motives behind his slayings . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt this is exactly the mistake mills makes . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt he's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt in his mind he didn't kill " innocent " people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt really , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt seven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt besides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . 
pos/cv731_4136.txt but then again , its a cruel world .

pos/cv039_6170.txt that thing you do ! 
pos/cv039_6170.txt  ( r ) tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , " that thing you do ! " 
pos/cv039_6170.txt the group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls " the last innocent year . " 
pos/cv039_6170.txt the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this ) . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting " retro . " 
pos/cv039_6170.txt yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt there isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it's just about impossible to hate . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt it's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , " that thing you do ! " --quite 
pos/cv039_6170.txt possibly for days . 
pos/cv039_6170.txt to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play " that thing you do ! "

pos/cv715_18179.txt bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
pos/cv715_18179.txt i must admit , no doubt's single " new " is quite catchy . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt the result ? 
pos/cv715_18179.txt a movie that's just as good as that song , really . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt first we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt really , it's all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt the movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt think of it as a , well , ending . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . 
pos/cv715_18179.txt however , it's better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn't .
