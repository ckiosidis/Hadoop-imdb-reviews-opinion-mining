neg/cv982_22209.txt i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt i guess my memory really sucks . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt michael o'keefe plays said caddy . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt nothing about this movie works . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt in reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the " hot babe " of the movie walking by in her bikini . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . 
neg/cv982_22209.txt but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack . 


neg/cv229_15200.txt

neg/cv229_15200.txt it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt take adam sandler . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt on the basis of his first two cds ( " they're all gonna laugh at you ! " 
neg/cv229_15200.txt and " what the hell happened to me ? " ) , 
neg/cv229_15200.txt he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt but when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn't the same . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt seriously , i'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt the first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it's scenes of emotional abuse towards adam's character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt granted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i'm even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it's nearly hour and a half running time . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt you're all familiar with the plot because you've seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt and believe me , i'm not giving anything away by saying that sandler's team wins . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt i mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt kudos to both of them . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show . 
neg/cv229_15200.txt with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can't keep going on like this . 


neg/cv805_21128.txt

neg/cv805_21128.txt my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt i didn't see the first film until much later . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a " hook " for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ? 
neg/cv805_21128.txt don't get me wrong though . . . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt other extras include the " jump to a nightmare " feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt most of the time you'll forget he's even there . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt however you can only access one easily . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt the other is hidden in what's called " the labyrinth " , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt basically , it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film . 
neg/cv805_21128.txt finding it though is both a chore and a bore .

neg/cv702_12371.txt

neg/cv702_12371.txt in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt eight years later , moore and goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt every so often , like at the end of a video game " level " or " stage , " the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what , all of red's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt once you've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you've seen it every time . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog . 
neg/cv702_12371.txt regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ? 


neg/cv567_29420.txt

neg/cv567_29420.txt in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 
neg/cv567_29420.txt and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt the second lamest device , of course , is the , " oh , it was all a dream " resolution . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt and guess what ? 
neg/cv567_29420.txt this movie has both ! 
neg/cv567_29420.txt not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt -ed . ] 
neg/cv567_29420.txt when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? 
neg/cv567_29420.txt why would they shower in their clothes ? 
neg/cv567_29420.txt what if they weren't covered in latex paint ? 
neg/cv567_29420.txt the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt at least he's friends with wes anderson . 
neg/cv567_29420.txt bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . 


neg/cv413_7893.txt

neg/cv413_7893.txt there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . " 
neg/cv413_7893.txt this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt yes , " the poseidon adventure " is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt and " earthquake , " my god ! 
neg/cv413_7893.txt  " earthquake " has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt  " volcano " takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only 
neg/cv413_7893.txt it's in , dare i say it ? 
neg/cv413_7893.txt l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt they're just stupid . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt and the actors are all good ones . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt anne heche is a good indy actress . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt don cheadle stole the disappointing " devil in a blue dress " from denzel's feet . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film ) . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt in " independence day , " the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt that was cool . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt okay , so the film's not devoid of merit . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt john carrol lynch ( norm from " fargo " ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt he has one guy who's wounded and could make it . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt he could throw the guy and jump and still survive . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt but no ! ! ! 
neg/cv413_7893.txt he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt here's the cool sight : he melts . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt cool sight . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt no logic . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt but cool sight . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt i haven't seen " dante's peak " but i've heard it's a masterpiece compared to this . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt simpson ( he saves a cat ) . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this . 
neg/cv413_7893.txt but i warned you . 


neg/cv255_15267.txt

neg/cv255_15267.txt movies don't come much more ridiculously titled than " i still know what you did last summer , " but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt more than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what " you " did _last_ summer " you " actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since " i " knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it's really illogical to say that " i " _still_ know what " you " did _last_ summer . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter " i still know , " the longer " i still know what you did two summers ago " or the appropriate " stupid people getting hacked to bits . " 
neg/cv255_15267.txt that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt for example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? 
neg/cv255_15267.txt probably not , but that's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt julie , you'll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997's surprise hit " i know what you did last summer , " after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it's a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt in this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt yeah , right . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt their island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt he sports the same gorton's fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he's still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt though i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt in a sense , that's the movie's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway's derivative " i still know " screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ?

neg/cv255_15267.txt even prequel " summer " lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt the innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and " scream " wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into " i know " 's unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like " yo " ; you'll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . 
neg/cv255_15267.txt if " i know what you did last summer , " however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive " scream " flicks poked fun at , then the deadly " i still know what you did last summer " deserves a full-blown roasting on " mystery science theatre 3000 . "

neg/cv740_13643.txt in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as " a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . " 
neg/cv740_13643.txt one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ? 
neg/cv740_13643.txt hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt with such an unappealing set of characters , it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt ho-hum . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film's climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film's lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt and then there's some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : " look at all these pickles . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt just looking at them gives me such great sadness . " 
neg/cv740_13643.txt as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin . 
neg/cv740_13643.txt they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .

neg/cv651_11120.txt the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt as the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt where exactly does all this go ? 
neg/cv651_11120.txt that's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt and another . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt and another . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt that is most certainly the case here . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt the real blonde is not without some amusements . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) . 
neg/cv651_11120.txt but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside .

neg/cv835_20531.txt

neg/cv835_20531.txt under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt cut to the " next fall " , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has " the sixth sense " , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt and this , as they say , is where the healing begins . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of " siskel and ebert " ) . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt it's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt and when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt i won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few " twilight zone " episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt the fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt i wouldn't have even known about this mental disease if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught " dateline nbc " the other week when they did a feature story on it . 
neg/cv835_20531.txt despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .
