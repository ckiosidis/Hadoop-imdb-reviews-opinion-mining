pos/cv455_29000.txt  " how do you know when you're finished making love ? " 
pos/cv455_29000.txt -jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting 
pos/cv455_29000.txt jackson pollock's " making love " quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , " it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means . " 
pos/cv455_29000.txt it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt  ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) 
pos/cv455_29000.txt granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable " purpose " of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , " you paint the fucking thing , " and leaves in a huff . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt  ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . ) 
pos/cv455_29000.txt such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : " you are killing me ! 
pos/cv455_29000.txt you are killing me ! 
pos/cv455_29000.txt you are killing me ! " 
pos/cv455_29000.txt  ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . ) 
pos/cv455_29000.txt pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break . 
pos/cv455_29000.txt a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .

pos/cv790_14600.txt tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt it's hilarious . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? 
pos/cv790_14600.txt easy . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will 
pos/cv790_14600.txt and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt ted " unabomber " 
pos/cv790_14600.txt kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks 
pos/cv790_14600.txt don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in 
pos/cv790_14600.txt need of a lot of laughs . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt go with a date . 
pos/cv790_14600.txt brandi laughed non-stop , as i 
pos/cv790_14600.txt did , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes .

pos/cv244_21649.txt  " being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt other than that , i had a very enjoyable time . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt the acting was quite delightful as well . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt who else's mind would be better to explore ? 
pos/cv244_21649.txt the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt he too is likely too receive media attention . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt  " being john malkovich " isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite . 
pos/cv244_21649.txt what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am 
pos/cv244_21649.txt i nick lyons ?

pos/cv764_11739.txt i love this movie , and i've just seen for the umptenth time . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt unfortunately , it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt it's my mission in life to spread the word : see this movie ! 
pos/cv764_11739.txt fred , george , doug and howie are reaching middleage . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt three of them have a wife , kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt only fred is still a bachelor . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt together they take the local train every morning to work in town . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar , fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt since they always split everything four ways , they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well , kathy . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt however , kathy isn't completly honest to them . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt in fact , she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt ok , have one thing clear though . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt the romantic rendezvous' between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt the script stays above the waist - or to be precise , above the neck . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress , the four guys call her their 'companion' . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years , but that only shows how long ago 1962 was . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt small children could watch this without being corrupted . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie , even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt tony randall is funny as always . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt 1962 was more than 35 years ago . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt how many accountants , copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work ? 
pos/cv764_11739.txt this is the white middle class , i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves . 
pos/cv764_11739.txt perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ? 


pos/cv717_15953.txt

pos/cv717_15953.txt since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that " beloved " come as a real shock as a film . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt  " beloved " is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , " beloved " comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt  " beloved " tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt sethe is proud , though , and will not move . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies " it ain't evil . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it's just sad . " 
pos/cv717_15953.txt some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt  " beloved " acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , " they took my milk ! " 
pos/cv717_15953.txt worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt thus , " beloved " becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , " solaris , " where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt  " beloved " moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in " the color purple , " but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if 
pos/cv717_15953.txt she was strictly an actress . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt emotion . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt sadness . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt strength . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt she makes it real . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt that's not to say this is a perfect film . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt act like a baby . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt throw things . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt stumble around . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt chew food with your mouth open . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt i do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt it's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , " beloved " has still not done well . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic " caligula , " the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . 
pos/cv717_15953.txt although i respect " beloved , " i can't say that i really enjoyed it .

pos/cv713_29155.txt in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship while trying to define their own in writer/director tran anh hung's ( " the scent of green papaya " ) " the vertical ray of the sun . " 
pos/cv713_29155.txt youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen-khe ) greets the day with hai ( ngo quanq hai ) , the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suong's ( nguyen nhu quynh ) cafe , where lien works , for breakfast . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt the three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial banquet of traditional delicacies , prepared as much for look as taste , while giggling over the differences between the sexes . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt after the family breaks from the banquet , we learn that suong's young son 'little monkey' is doted upon , but there's a distance developing with her husband quoc ( chu ngoc hung ) , who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt middle sister khanh ( tran manh cuong ) tells her writer husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan , a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt lien keeps crawling into hai's bed at night , causing him to fall out of it . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later , as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt  " the vertical ray of the sun " is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt sly humor , self deceit and harsh truths all exist in the cyclic screenplay . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark lee ping-bin ( " flowers of shanghai " ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film's visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt writer/director tran anh hung's film recalls ang lee's " eat drink man woman , " another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt but while lee's more traditionally story-driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , " the vertical ray of the sun's " characters strive for peaceful harmony . 
pos/cv713_29155.txt watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day . 


pos/cv019_14482.txt

pos/cv019_14482.txt there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? 
pos/cv019_14482.txt he's in " there's something about mary , " which i * still * haven't seen . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt and he's in the acerbic " your friends & neighbors , " playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt now there's " permanent midnight , " in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in " emma " and " brassed off , " received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , " trainspotting . " 
pos/cv019_14482.txt the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt  " permanent midnight " is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt a habit , in stahl's own words , " the size of utah . " 
pos/cv019_14482.txt as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt unlike " trainspotting , " which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , " permanent midnight " instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to " naked lunch " author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , " so i can shave . " 
pos/cv019_14482.txt stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in " permanent midnight " ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt  " permanent midnight " shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- " escape the drug scene " ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . 
pos/cv019_14482.txt the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see " permanent midnight " ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . 


pos/cv091_7400.txt

pos/cv091_7400.txt accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt one could almost say the same about his much-prized film . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt bore is perhaps too strong a word . 
pos/cv091_7400.txt but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full .

pos/cv521_15828.txt one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt probably the greatest " feel-good " film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt clarence has got his own problems , however . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt one christmas , potter gets his chance . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt without the money , the bank must close down . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it's a wonderful life does have its faults . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there are , however , endearing moments in all of this . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it's a little too nice for my liking , at times . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt stewart , however , is the king of all of this . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying " merry christmas " to all objects , animate or inanimate . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt but he is james stewart , and he's lovably delightful throughout the film . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt have i complained ? 
pos/cv521_15828.txt i shouldn't have . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt this is a really good movie . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt no , this is a great movie . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt better yet , this is a phenomenal movie . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt this is one of those films . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it is a " feel-good " movie , something people complain a little too much about . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt but capra's reworking of " a christmas carol " is the greatest christmas movie of all time . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt there , i've said it . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt they all loved it . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt is it a little too sugar-coated ? 
pos/cv521_15828.txt maybe . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt no matter . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt this is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt it is frank capra's greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt for about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt the rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . 
pos/cv521_15828.txt i can't get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is .

pos/cv279_18329.txt october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed " uplifting " film that is actually uplifting ! 
pos/cv279_18329.txt based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt it's 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there's not much hope of a rosy future . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt coalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt but , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt of course , homer's parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren't quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt and so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt but , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ? 
pos/cv279_18329.txt there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt however , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt >from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt unfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt they remain little more than placeholders reading " insert friend here " . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt of the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt however , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt however , these lapses are minimal , and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt the problem with many so-called " uplifting " films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat . 
pos/cv279_18329.txt october sky never resorts to that level , and yet , manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits .
