pos/cv788_25272.txt the classic neil simon comedy ( based on his own stage play ) about suicidal felix ( lemmon ) , who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar ( matthau ) to stay with him in his apartment after felix's wife throws him out and files for divorce . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt the hook : oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way , while felix is an obsessive/compulsive neat freak . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt the two men , despite their friendship , instantly clash . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt movies just aren't as delightfully funny as this one is . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt every line of neil simon's dialogue flows like comedic poetry , and all the actors are just perfect in their performances . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix , but it's matthau who shines brightest as oscar , whose world is being invaded and rearranged , mostly against his wishes ( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with ) . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti ? 
pos/cv788_25272.txt the best thing about the film ( and this is a testament to the quality of the writing ) is that it's a comedy with substance . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt these two men , even while at each other's throats , genuinely care for one another as friends . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt when they clash , it isn't cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt movies nowadays , take grumpy old men for example , just don't have that extra spark there . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt these days it's just animosity for the sake of comedy . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt a television series followed ( starring jack klugman and tony randall ) , which i'll admit i've never seen an episode of in its entirety , and neil simon even scripted the sequel , the odd couple ii , which was released in 1998 . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though . 
pos/cv788_25272.txt it's one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films .

pos/cv371_7630.txt 118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 
pos/cv371_7630.txt mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( " manga " ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as " labors " ( an interesting play on words , considering that " robot " is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt  ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) 
pos/cv371_7630.txt it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? 
pos/cv371_7630.txt are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? 
pos/cv371_7630.txt this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . 
pos/cv371_7630.txt although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .

pos/cv901_11017.txt people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt this movie has very good special effects , for the most part . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well .

pos/cv901_11017.txt one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt this movie is about what happens . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . 
pos/cv901_11017.txt it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying " cool " followed by a " what the hell ? ! ? ! " .

pos/cv568_15638.txt

pos/cv568_15638.txt eric rohmer's " pauline at the beach , " is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt  " pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's " my night at mauds , " and 1971's " claire's knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . 
pos/cv568_15638.txt  " pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing .

pos/cv571_29366.txt but an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn't reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt thank goodness for readers like him . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt  " hedwig and the angry inch " is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs .

pos/cv571_29366.txt as with " tommy , " " hedwig " tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio . 
pos/cv571_29366.txt life is an exercise in duality for hansel .

pos/cv571_29366.txt mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to " the angry inch " ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it ) .

pos/cv362_15341.txt elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt the film charts elizabeth's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt as a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt but her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt with few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt though not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt she is at home with her character's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt whether fending off unctuous suitors or " playing " the houses in court , blanchett's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur's visual delights . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt rolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt though writer michael hirst's script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt as a whole , the story survives because elizabeth's struggle is one which deserves attention . 
pos/cv362_15341.txt by the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we're ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen .

pos/cv139_12873.txt professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! 
pos/cv139_12873.txt arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt mother-in-law jokes prevail . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt this is what binds the movie together . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! 
pos/cv139_12873.txt even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . 
pos/cv139_12873.txt a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition .

pos/cv238_12931.txt  " six days , seven nights " is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt at a slim 101 minutes , " six days , seven nights " never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is " you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? " ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt even the movie's more " serious " moments are played with a wink . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the " believability " of " six days , seven nights " ' heterosexual pairing . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt  ( so she's a lesbian . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt so what . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt deal with it . ) 
pos/cv238_12931.txt of course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt after several wrong guesses ( " forty-five ? 
pos/cv238_12931.txt _fifty_ ? " ) , he whispers his age to her . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt  " you still look good , " heche stammers . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt  " i still _am_ good , " ford replies . 
pos/cv238_12931.txt she's good too , and together , they make " six days , seven nights " one memorable ride .

pos/cv247_13142.txt perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt out of sight proves that it doesn't . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt the supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt dennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt steve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt not every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . 
pos/cv247_13142.txt as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . 


pos/cv406_21020.txt

pos/cv406_21020.txt the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! 
pos/cv406_21020.txt i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt no words can describe the dvd . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt why is he stalking her ? 
pos/cv406_21020.txt check out halloween ii it explains it all . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt on this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt the movie is flawless if not perfect . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt 'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt 'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it's an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . 
pos/cv406_21020.txt see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then 
pos/cv406_21020.txt watch it again !
