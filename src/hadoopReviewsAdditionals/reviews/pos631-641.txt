pos/cv696_29740.txt capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt  , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv696_29740.txt more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt then there were tv series " a town like alice " and " tenko . " 
pos/cv696_29740.txt lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt beating and torture are commonplace events . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt conformity is purpose . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it is neither . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt this serves a double purpose for cunningham . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt it also creates a distancing effect . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . 
pos/cv696_29740.txt i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . 


pos/cv657_24513.txt

pos/cv657_24513.txt the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt one was _gattaca_ . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the other was _the thirteenth floor_ . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt _the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt no wonder it fell through the cracks . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt in fact , hannon fuller's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt d'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt there are one or two instances of jerky editing . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the script takes the edge off the film's climaxes . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt one wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt one can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : " make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy . " 
pos/cv657_24513.txt _the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci-fi movie . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt and yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right . 
pos/cv657_24513.txt for when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ? 
pos/cv657_24513.txt if we don't support great sf , who will ? 


pos/cv152_8736.txt

pos/cv152_8736.txt capsule : a rock and roll fable , indeed . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt like a hubert selby , jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen , and a ton of fun . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt streets of fire bills itself as " a rock and roll fable " , and the description is perfect . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt this is a stylish , great-looking , and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby , jr . , novel with a damon runyan rewrite , irected by bruce springsteen . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt noir is one of the few truly american movie genres , aside from the hollywood musical and the western . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt this is post-wwii brooklyn noir , for lack of a better label , with a generous injection of rock 'n roll and an all-around confrontational attitude . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt it all works . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt the plot is simplicity itself : rocker ellen aim ( diane lane ) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang , led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven ( willem dafoe , very nasty ) . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt her old soldier flame ( played by michael pare ) comes back into town to save her , but doesn't count on a whole bunch of things going askew . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt that's about the entire plot , save for the spats with ellen's manager ( a hilarious rick moranis ) , an encounter with a doo-wop group that winds up becoming ellen's supporting act , and a whole gang of other fun little touches . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt but in movies like this , when is the plot important ? 
pos/cv152_8736.txt the movie is all style , all visuals and attitudes , quotable lines and posturing -- and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt no surprise that it was directed by walter hill ( 48 hrs . ) , who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly , and has put together a movie that's a mixture of times and sensibilities , but perfectly unified in tone . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie , especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw ( * and * passes out ) every 2 . 63 minutes on cue ? 
pos/cv152_8736.txt streets of fire isn't the greatest movie ever made , but it occupies a totally unique little niche , and enjoys the position it has . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt anyone with a weakness for doo-wop , neon , motorcycles , rainy streets , the el , studebakers , gang pictures , lonely heroes , and a great-looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up . 
pos/cv152_8736.txt i did .

pos/cv273_29112.txt felix ( sami bouajila , " the siege " ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in " the adventures of felix . " 
pos/cv273_29112.txt writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy " jeanne and the perfect guy , " embracing that typically american genre . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt their second effort , " the adventures of felix , " once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of " cocktails " for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , " my little brother , " where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled " my grandmother , " and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled " my cousin , " he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled " my sister . " 
pos/cv273_29112.txt he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt on the final leg of the journey titled " my father , " he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt  " the adventures of felix " has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of " cocktails , " and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt only the " cousin " chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's " family . " 
pos/cv273_29112.txt  " the adventures of felix " does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside . 
pos/cv273_29112.txt i give it a b+ . 


pos/cv879_14903.txt

pos/cv879_14903.txt labelling is sometimes everything . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the future was much worse than his vision . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt in their vocabulary , word " arms " is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . 
pos/cv879_14903.txt all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . 


pos/cv570_29082.txt

pos/cv570_29082.txt plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt saying anything else about the plot would be a crime . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt have fun . . . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt critique : " i feel like shooting myself in the head " are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt this ain't your average " happy go lucky " kind of picture . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt will it bore some people to sleep ? 
pos/cv570_29082.txt you bet it will ! 
pos/cv570_29082.txt is it made for the scream audiences of the day ? 
pos/cv570_29082.txt absolutely not ! 
pos/cv570_29082.txt i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the " cerebral crowd " . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a " mindfuck " . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you ! 
pos/cv570_29082.txt it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole " peanut butter " thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt  " brrrrrrrrr . . . now 
pos/cv570_29082.txt what was that sound in the basement ? 
pos/cv570_29082.txt honey , can you go check ? " 
pos/cv570_29082.txt and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video . . . ah-ha ! ) . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied , kids ! ) . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt and as clich ? d as it might be to say . . . it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get " into " it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can , how can you go wrong ? 
pos/cv570_29082.txt definitely not a film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed ( count me in ! ) . 
pos/cv570_29082.txt stanley kubrick would be proud ! 
pos/cv570_29082.txt oh yeah . . . so 
pos/cv570_29082.txt where's that gun again . . . ? 
pos/cv570_29082.txt where's joblo coming from ?

pos/cv693_18063.txt

pos/cv693_18063.txt let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt in other words , the sound sucked . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt it is nothing short of stunning visually . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt although to his credit , it is one of his better performances . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the ending itself was just plain strange . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . 
pos/cv693_18063.txt while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . 


pos/cv151_15771.txt

pos/cv151_15771.txt near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . 
pos/cv151_15771.txt but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . 


pos/cv897_10837.txt

pos/cv897_10837.txt i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of " good will hunting " , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but " good will hunting " rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt what makes " good will hunting " work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious " right " and " wrong " side and beating them over the head with it . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt for a film with such an extraordinary character , " good will hunting " presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt  " good will hunting " also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt add all this to the fact that " good will hunting " even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . 
pos/cv897_10837.txt still , " good will hunting " takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films . 


pos/cv757_10189.txt

pos/cv757_10189.txt scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt scream 2 ! 
pos/cv757_10189.txt 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! 
pos/cv757_10189.txt a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! 
pos/cv757_10189.txt sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled " stab " , which has been developed into a major motion picture . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of " stab " , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown " copycat " sets out to repeat what's been done . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt and finish what hasn't ! 
pos/cv757_10189.txt of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt i will note , however , that the " whodunit ? " 
pos/cv757_10189.txt did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt all the actors outdo themselves here . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) 
pos/cv757_10189.txt than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt like they say , don't mess with perfection . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt  . 
pos/cv757_10189.txt but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ?
