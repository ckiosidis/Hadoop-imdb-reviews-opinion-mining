pos/cv801_25228.txt this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play " hospitality suite . ''its 
pos/cv801_25228.txt about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt  " the big kahuna " revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the contrast in their personalities is stark . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he tells him to go on a vacation . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt get a woman . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt this is his first time for him on the road . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller's attention about their company's product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . 
pos/cv801_25228.txt but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see . 


pos/cv241_23130.txt

pos/cv241_23130.txt there was a lot riding on this movie . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt everyone even moderately interested in the " scream " series was dying to know how it would end . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt what would be the " final act " ? 
pos/cv241_23130.txt this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into " scream " while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt no need to worry ; " scream 3 " is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt so , how does the story go ? 
pos/cv241_23130.txt as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in " eye for an eye " ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within " scream " has now become totally fictional . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt sometimes both . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt clever , indeed . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt but , who goes next ? 
pos/cv241_23130.txt no one knows . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the " scream " 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through " woodsboro , " written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of " scream 3 " ? ? ? s finest moments . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the " scream " fan . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said " dramatic element " ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with " scream " . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt honestly , i like this approach . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt some critics have noted that " scream 3 " seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt all in all , " scream 3 " does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt as a trilogy , " scream " was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt almost sad to see it go . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt but then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and " scream 3 " does a fine job of providing closure to its characters . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt for now , " scream " holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid . 
pos/cv241_23130.txt not too shabby . 


pos/cv204_8451.txt

pos/cv204_8451.txt being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , " shall we dance " won't be seen by that many people . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt and that's a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt the surprising thing about " shall we dance " is the universal appeal of the story . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt a us version is in the works , and it's no wonder - it's not really all that culture specific . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt although there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt the only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you'll know why ) . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn't translate into a fulfilled life . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt we then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt later on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co-worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt the story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt it's a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt it's difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt it's one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt just a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you . 
pos/cv204_8451.txt when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ? 
pos/cv204_8451.txt  " shall we dance " will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste . 


pos/cv992_11962.txt

pos/cv992_11962.txt here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt but , the thing is , it isn't . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt it's about how much it can get into one film . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt well , it would seem that he has succeeded . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt of course , he isn't the first ever . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt no life lives on it . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt that is , no visible life . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt they blame it on a technical malfunction . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , this time around , most of her " alien " urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt and it has . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt and it does it quite well . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , i tend to disagree . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt what were the alien films about ? 
pos/cv992_11962.txt and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? 
pos/cv992_11962.txt my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the acting is quite good for this kind of film . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt okay , so it isn't that good . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt and , of course , justin lazard . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ? 
pos/cv992_11962.txt the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt hell , i don't even know if i will . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . 
pos/cv992_11962.txt medak has also mastered the wonderful " jump ! "

pos/cv992_11962.txt strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . 


pos/cv833_11053.txt

pos/cv833_11053.txt seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word " routine . " 
pos/cv833_11053.txt i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and " donnie brasco " clinches this idea . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt aside from a few minor , general flaws , " donnie brasco " manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . 
pos/cv833_11053.txt it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful . 


pos/cv948_24606.txt

pos/cv948_24606.txt any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it " more accessible " to the general public . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt human traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt the cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt koop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt nina herself can't stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt lulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip's best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt and moff ( danny dyer ) can't seem to escape the black hole of his awful life . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan's subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt however , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene . 
pos/cv948_24606.txt instead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace .

pos/cv635_10022.txt in one scene from " the people vs . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt larry flynt , " the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in " patton " where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt overall , that sums up " the people vs . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt larry flynt . " 
pos/cv635_10022.txt the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on " what guys really want , " explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's " naughtiness . " 
pos/cv635_10022.txt director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) 
pos/cv635_10022.txt as keating blathers about flynt's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt flynt's other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt  " the people vs , larry flynt " is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt  " if they'll protect a scumbag like me , then they'll protect all of you , " declared flynt . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt he's right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt despite its flaws , " flynt " is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . 
pos/cv635_10022.txt the story may be candy-coated , but it's still delicious candy . 


pos/cv396_17989.txt

pos/cv396_17989.txt well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the plot in brief . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt but these are minor complaints . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt just see it . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . 
pos/cv396_17989.txt and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . 


pos/cv459_20319.txt

pos/cv459_20319.txt the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i've seen in years . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt but then again , i've always had this phobia of asian born horror films . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced , long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt unlike the horror films coming from the west , i'm pretty much used to the gore and visual effects , so much so , they become rather bland nowadays . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt there's really no scary movie from the west for a long time . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt if you have something in mind , please tell me . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan' , which is also ( i heard ) televised over the air in japan . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it , one week prior to viewing . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt a journalist and her husband , stupid enough , tests the so call `urban legend' and ends up having a week before she meets her doom . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt she and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette , to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt visual subtlety , minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt very well done indeed , especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt now , thats something budding horror film-maker wannabes should consider looking into . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt just an idea of how visually powerful the film is , it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese ; both of which , i can't understand at all ( ok , i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching , but he revealed very little ! ) . 
pos/cv459_20319.txt the twists in the plot , leading to an unforgettable climax ( will definitely leave an impression on the audience ) will have you at the edge of your seat . 


pos/cv118_28980.txt

pos/cv118_28980.txt plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? 
pos/cv118_28980.txt kewl ! 
pos/cv118_28980.txt critique : despite this film not looking like a " tim burton movie " or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! 
pos/cv118_28980.txt i also have to " give it up " to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of " human beings as animals " then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt i also hated the " kid " character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you 
pos/cv118_28980.txt coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt the " surprise ending " that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt so overall , i loved the whole " feel " of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( " this is a mad house ! " - 
pos/cv118_28980.txt type of thing ) . 
pos/cv118_28980.txt the guy in this film barely seems to be " put off " by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! 
pos/cv118_28980.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
pos/cv118_28980.txt the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )
