neg/cv633_29730.txt  " what's your favorite new york moment ? " 
neg/cv633_29730.txt  " this one's climbing the charts . " 
neg/cv633_29730.txt starring john cusack , kate beckinsale , eugene levy , molly shannon . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt directed by peter chelsom . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt rated pg-13 . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt there's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt in rare cases , the genders are flipped . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt predictability is a given . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its " theme " as an excuse for its plot contrivances . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt  " lightweight " doesn't begin to describe it . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt this is like anti-gravity . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( " love in the time of cholera " ) and sell it to a used bookstore . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt three years later . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt both realize they aren't content . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt both go looking for the other . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt what happens now is so absurd that i'm almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible " coincidences " that i would describe as contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around " serendipity . " 
neg/cv633_29730.txt of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt i'm not buying it . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt there's no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what's going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly " adorable " non-story into our heads . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt instead of " will they meet ? " 
neg/cv633_29730.txt the question we're asking is " when will they meet already ? " 
neg/cv633_29730.txt to make matters worse , every " coincidence " is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else " incredible " was going to happen . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt cusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn't saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she's had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy , who plays a snarky bloomingdale's salesman . 
neg/cv633_29730.txt what's the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ? 
neg/cv633_29730.txt serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings , but it only tests our patience . 


neg/cv307_26382.txt

neg/cv307_26382.txt this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the director is paul verhoven . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the problem is to keep us there . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself " god " , has discovered the secret to invisibility . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the first two faces are completed . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt now , it is time for " the next logical step " -- human . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt caine volunteers for this risky experiment . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt soon every sense of decency is forgotten . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt this is a very silly production . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt laughable , actually . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt he becomes a rapist . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt and then , of course , a murderer . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt being probably the best technical achievement since " jurassic park " , they are absolutely amazing . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? 
neg/cv307_26382.txt what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt pretty much like jan de bont ( " twister " , " haunting " ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt he was responsible for several good films ( " basic instinct " and " starship troopers ) " and some incredibly bad films ( " showgirls " , " total recall " ) , but he has never made anything that was great . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt in a way " hollow man " fits perfectly in this collection . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt it's not better or worse than verhoven's average film . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot's of dull action with blood and naked bodies . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you'll be screaming " nooooo ! " 
neg/cv307_26382.txt and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt and all we can ask is why ? 
neg/cv307_26382.txt the answer is simple . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt to make us care , to make us think and feel . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt it's all flesh and bones , but no soul . 
neg/cv307_26382.txt a void where its imagination should be . 


neg/cv996_12447.txt

neg/cv996_12447.txt john boorman's " zardoz " is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain " zardoz " ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful " exorcist ii : the heretic " ) . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece " deliverance " ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama " hope and glory " ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic " excalibur " ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure " the emerald forest " ( 1985 ) . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt  " zardoz " is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie's plot . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt it's more middle ages than space age . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt the world of " zardoz " is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt like " the wizard of oz , " he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt  ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) 
neg/cv996_12447.txt calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , " the gun is good . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt the penis is evil . " 
neg/cv996_12447.txt that line alone is worth the movie's cult following . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt once there , the immortals label him a " brutal " and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt i say " hilarious " because that is exactly what " zardoz " is . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of " deliverance , " which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in " zardoz " besides the inadvertent humor . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt he got exactly that in " zardoz , " and it's a wonder it didn't end his career . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? 
neg/cv996_12447.txt is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? 
neg/cv996_12447.txt or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? 
neg/cv996_12447.txt karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . 
neg/cv996_12447.txt people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . 


neg/cv912_5562.txt

neg/cv912_5562.txt my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled " dragnet " reruns off the air . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt even though " dragnet " is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous " blue boy " episode of " dragnet . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt as what would happen if sgt . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the " produced and directed by jack webb " card pretty much goes without saying . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt gives us more -- much more . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will " personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt  ( whether the " lace panties " part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) 
neg/cv912_5562.txt this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt  " now you listen to me , youngster . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt  ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , " just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt bogart he ain't . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the other d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , " he's a damn good d . i . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt  . . . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt i guess i'm just a little jealous . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt  " you expect me to talk to you . . . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt in _here_ ? ! " he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt a little girl spots him in the store and demands , " what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , " what an odd species of human -- so small . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , " was that flea you killed a male or female ? " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt owens replies , " a male , sir . " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt webb yells to the platoon , " this ain't the one ! " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . 
neg/cv912_5562.txt webb bursts in the room and shouts , " what did i tell you about laughing ? ! " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt to which the private replies , " sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! " 
neg/cv912_5562.txt and let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie .

neg/cv373_21872.txt it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some " rosemary's baby " , along with " the devil's advocate " a little " exorcist " and some " stigmata " here and there . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt whala you have " end of days " a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt that's pretty much it on plot . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt as for arnie ? 
neg/cv373_21872.txt good role , ok performance . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in " stigmata " ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun " the devil's advocate " and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in " stigmata " . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the sad thing is that " end of days " had so many things going for it . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt at times it seems like " armageddon " and started to get old and tiresome . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt even with its 100m budget " end of days " is less than pleasing . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch . 
neg/cv373_21872.txt overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm 
neg/cv373_21872.txt yup those pretty much describe " end of days " . 


neg/cv225_29083.txt

neg/cv225_29083.txt plot : a rich guy who doesn't believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt but what's this ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt wow . . . a 
neg/cv225_29083.txt sin , indeed . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt critique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt  ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt okay , so where do i start ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two " lovers " go through the motions until the " betrayal " occurs . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt whoopee , big surprise . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt why ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt every look in jolie's eyes screams " psycho " ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt then of course , you have the case of the " patsy " husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt i mean . . . how 
neg/cv225_29083.txt boring is that for the audience ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt you're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt no , thanks ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt and if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt well , i'll tell you . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt well , it's actually pretty simple . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record ) . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt try imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but 
neg/cv225_29083.txt without the plot ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt that's pretty much what you've got here . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt a low point in the careers of both stars . 
neg/cv225_29083.txt oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god 
neg/cv225_29083.txt oh mighty . . . make 
neg/cv225_29083.txt it stop ! ! 
neg/cv225_29083.txt where's joblo coming from ? 
neg/cv225_29083.txt american psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 ) 


neg/cv776_21934.txt

neg/cv776_21934.txt the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film " the world is not enough " is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming " james bond will return . " 
neg/cv776_21934.txt oh i certainly hope not . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , " the world is not enough " is the best example to date that " 'enough " is enough . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt in this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt we've got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt we've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache ) . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt and , as has been the case since 1977's " the spy who loved me , " we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt we've also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from " tomorrow never dies . " 
neg/cv776_21934.txt while originality was never the series' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt i can't think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- " the world is not enough . " 
neg/cv776_21934.txt in addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as " coal miner's daughter , " " nell , " and the " 28up " documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt you get the " talking killer " plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt and you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can't hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film's opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond's souped-up " fishing boat " with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt later , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt in and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , " braveheart " 's sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she's terrible ) , " wild things " ' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she's laughable ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond's walther ppk ) . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you'd expect of the former " remington steele " star , but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck . 
neg/cv776_21934.txt he's given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver , but only one of them-- " i don't know any doctor jokes " --made me chuckle ( although " i thought christmas only comes once a year " is more in keeping with the series' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) . 


neg/cv686_15553.txt

neg/cv686_15553.txt look ! the new version of " psycho " came out and the world didn't end ! 
neg/cv686_15553.txt i guess gus van sant really isn't the bringer of the apocalypse ! 
neg/cv686_15553.txt unfortunately , though , that " psycho " didn't end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt van sant's controversial " re-telling " of alfred hitchcock's classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) 
neg/cv686_15553.txt without benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt being an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word " suck " and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) 
neg/cv686_15553.txt director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) 
neg/cv686_15553.txt the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt sadly , that did not occur . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original " psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt in moore's case , the film would have been helped if " the x- files " gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! 
neg/cv686_15553.txt from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! 
neg/cv686_15553.txt mortensen ( who i liked in " g . i . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt jane " ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt sam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that's about it . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt anne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt at least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can't be said for most of the rest of the cast . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt the best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama's boy , norman bates . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt he's not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt there is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt van sant has made a boring film . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren't as eye-catching now . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don't impress or excite . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt van sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) 
neg/cv686_15553.txt these images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt definitely not hitchcock's intention ! 
neg/cv686_15553.txt at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann's original famous and terrific score . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt if a film like " psycho " does not frighten , then what's the point . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt aside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting . 
neg/cv686_15553.txt in the end , however , the new " psycho " is a noble attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure . 


neg/cv589_12853.txt

neg/cv589_12853.txt this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! 
neg/cv589_12853.txt this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! 
neg/cv589_12853.txt jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . 
neg/cv589_12853.txt it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !

neg/cv042_11927.txt a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists .

neg/cv042_11927.txt living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt 24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "

neg/cv042_11927.txt syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being " pigeonholed , " and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses .

neg/cv042_11927.txt and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . 
neg/cv042_11927.txt high art runs 1 : 36 .
