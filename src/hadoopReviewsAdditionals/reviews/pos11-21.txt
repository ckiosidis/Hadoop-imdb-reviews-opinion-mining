pos/cv827_18331.txt it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in 
pos/cv827_18331.txt other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , 
pos/cv827_18331.txt not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . 
pos/cv827_18331.txt the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .

pos/cv977_4938.txt richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt i wasn't disappointed . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt one thing : what's with the title ? 
pos/cv977_4938.txt not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt richard gere does a fairly good job . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt his female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt the best performance in the film was by edward norton . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt he was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged " butcher boy of st . mike's " . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt i was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . 
pos/cv977_4938.txt i liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating .

pos/cv735_18801.txt vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
pos/cv735_18801.txt and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt there's an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt  ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
pos/cv735_18801.txt you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
pos/cv735_18801.txt the audience was in stitches . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt there are many good things about this sequel . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt this works surprisingly well . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt oh , yes . . . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt the plot . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt here , it's time travel . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt and as for fat bastard . . . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! 
pos/cv735_18801.txt but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt  ( c ) 1999 , jamey hughton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
pos/cv735_18801.txt jamey hughton ( 15 ) has written a weekly column in the starphoenix , saskatoon , sk since november , 1997 .

pos/cv160_10362.txt corey yuen's latest film , " hero " is notable on two fronts . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt poverty and crime rule most of china . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's " eastern condors " , is a marvelous surprise . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the action scenes do not disappoint either . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike' . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both " titanic " and " rosewood " as best of the year . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt all in all , " hero " marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers . 
pos/cv160_10362.txt this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing . 


pos/cv078_14730.txt

pos/cv078_14730.txt the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! 
pos/cv078_14730.txt also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . 
pos/cv078_14730.txt overall rating=

pos/cv869_23611.txt

pos/cv869_23611.txt have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? 
pos/cv869_23611.txt or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? 
pos/cv869_23611.txt these thought-provoking questions are the subject of " final destination , " which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's " the sixth sense . " 
pos/cv869_23611.txt stylishly filmed and tautly directed by " x-files " alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written " teen-speak , " rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious " coincidences , " including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song " rocky mountain high " over the sound system in the airport bathroom . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt  " john denver died in a plane crash , " alex grudgingly mutters to himself . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt alex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt the teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt that is only the setup of " final destination , " and the less said about what follows , the better . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and " final destination " surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , " idle hands , " is even more of a charismatic presence here . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt ali larter ( 1999's " varsity blues " ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt the movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt tony todd ( 1992's " candyman " ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt ultimately , what is so good about " final destination " is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films . 
pos/cv869_23611.txt if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .

pos/cv710_22577.txt `run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt `run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt `lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt both actors perform beyond the call of duty . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt `run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . 
pos/cv710_22577.txt like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting . 


pos/cv991_18645.txt

pos/cv991_18645.txt i don't box with kid gloves . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt i still , however , will not go easy on them . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . ' 
pos/cv991_18645.txt in down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt the plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt from there we go into a delightful parody . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt for once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . 
pos/cv991_18645.txt it's almost as much fun as the film . 


pos/cv222_17395.txt

pos/cv222_17395.txt waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . ' 
pos/cv222_17395.txt in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? 
pos/cv222_17395.txt through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt lang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty . 
pos/cv222_17395.txt reprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity . 


pos/cv668_17604.txt

pos/cv668_17604.txt in december of 1996 , a little movie called " scream , " was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both " scream " movies , " i know what you did last summer , " " urban legend , " etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's " can't hardly wait . " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : " varsity blues , " " jawbreaker , " " cruel intentions , " " simply irresistible , " " the rage : carrie 2 , " and " the mod squad . " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt coming april 9 are two more of this type : " never been kissed " and " go , " and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire " election " and the teen horror-comedy " idle hands . " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt jeesh ! 
pos/cv668_17604.txt out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , " 10 things i hate about you , " is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum " she's all that . " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , " 10 things i hate about you , " a modern-day version of shakespeare's " the taming of the shrew " ( " she's all that " got its inspiration from " pygmalion " ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's " the breakfast club . " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in " she's all that ? " ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt as you can see , " 10 things i hate about you " includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of " she's all that , " where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , " you're vapor " ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( " 3rd rock from the sun " ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries " the '60s " ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl " chill " mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt in one very funny scene , chastity asks , " i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? " 
pos/cv668_17604.txt at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt  " 10 things i hate about you " once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . 
pos/cv668_17604.txt luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about " 10 things i hate about you , " but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .
