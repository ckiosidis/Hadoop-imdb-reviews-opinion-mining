neg/cv987_7394.txt please don't mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i 
neg/cv987_7394.txt just want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt it's not even worth a 99-cent video rental . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) 
neg/cv987_7394.txt btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt now i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt here goes : 
neg/cv987_7394.txt movie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt even then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) 
neg/cv987_7394.txt why do i hate anaconda ? 
neg/cv987_7394.txt let me count the ways . . . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt first of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt as an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt whew . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt he was the most likable character in the movie . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt who wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? 
neg/cv987_7394.txt anaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy , for instance . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt however , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt the writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt did she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? 
neg/cv987_7394.txt of course not ! 
neg/cv987_7394.txt  " i'm trying to work ! " 
neg/cv987_7394.txt gee , that's even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt she could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt  ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt as for the plot , i'm still trying to find one . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt  ( harrier snake ? ) 
neg/cv987_7394.txt not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy's g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt that was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt  ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i'd be most grateful ! 
neg/cv987_7394.txt all the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) 
neg/cv987_7394.txt i wasn't inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt i can't blame the actors , though . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt it's not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt this concludes rydain's diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . 
neg/cv987_7394.txt comments , flames , anyone ? 
neg/cv987_7394.txt -rydain the atomic cheese , fresh from chernobyl dairies ! 


neg/cv798_24779.txt

neg/cv798_24779.txt a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt howard pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt after a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt jeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt he incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt things change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt realizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt as a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt while with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt in jail , things look bad for him . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt no one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt out on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt through a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt he is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . 
neg/cv798_24779.txt it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw . 


neg/cv057_7962.txt

neg/cv057_7962.txt supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt we only see one side of each character . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt kilmer is a bridge builder and that's all we see him as . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn't even appear to be too upset about it . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt and the plot ? 
neg/cv057_7962.txt it's jaws , but with lions . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt again we're presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt it appears to kill men because it just likes too . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt why ? 
neg/cv057_7962.txt who knows . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt i guess there wouldn't be much of a story if it didn't . 
neg/cv057_7962.txt the problem is that there isn't much of a story even though it does . 


neg/cv479_5450.txt

neg/cv479_5450.txt i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , " don't blame me , i just work here . " 
neg/cv479_5450.txt perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt and those are the real jokes in eddie . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , " hey , it's donald trump ! " 
neg/cv479_5450.txt or " hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! " 
neg/cv479_5450.txt it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt the knicks coach who is eddie's antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn't given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . 
neg/cv479_5450.txt it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy . 


neg/cv159_29374.txt

neg/cv159_29374.txt synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt review : " evolution " certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt it's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his " ghostbusters " success into a twenty-first-century counterpart . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his " x-files " character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt and then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt  " evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for . 
neg/cv159_29374.txt  " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . 


neg/cv120_3793.txt

neg/cv120_3793.txt starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the " savages " that live there . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while " slightly " misguided , is good at heart . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt she even comes complete with insignificant best friend . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , " colors of the wind . " 
neg/cv120_3793.txt mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt even the children in the audience seemed restless . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? 
neg/cv120_3793.txt i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . 
neg/cv120_3793.txt while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . 


neg/cv803_8584.txt

neg/cv803_8584.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt be forewarned . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt this is a promising premise , and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt this is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt however , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt unfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt far from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt mr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as " you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? ' 
neg/cv803_8584.txt - see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions . " ) 
neg/cv803_8584.txt the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . 
neg/cv803_8584.txt for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .

neg/cv111_12253.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt be forewarned . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- " if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable " warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt mr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- " something bad happened here . " 
neg/cv111_12253.txt this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter " this is awful . " 
neg/cv111_12253.txt and she's not even empathic ! 
neg/cv111_12253.txt and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , " he's going to rape her . " 
neg/cv111_12253.txt while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt there's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( " he's in aisle 1 ! " 
neg/cv111_12253.txt informs eve ) . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ? 
neg/cv111_12253.txt why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? 
neg/cv111_12253.txt my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . 
neg/cv111_12253.txt ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that " she's so empowered . " 
neg/cv111_12253.txt a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment . 


neg/cv350_22139.txt

neg/cv350_22139.txt  " what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? " 
neg/cv350_22139.txt that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt so bad , it's almost good . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt almost , but not quite . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt the acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt actually , it was the high point of the movie for me . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt of course , that isn't really saying much . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt which gives it a leg up on some other horror films . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt not a great one , but it is there . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt just don't be too upset if you can't find it . 
neg/cv350_22139.txt you really won't be missing that much . 


neg/cv642_29788.txt

neg/cv642_29788.txt the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's " take on me " in his yellow miata . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? 
neg/cv642_29788.txt honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt man , was i wrong . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt corky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( " you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps . " ) . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt predictably , hijinks ensue . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( " that's pronounced pees-ahn . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt it's french . " ) . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt and not a good sitcom , i mean . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt but it's not a complete disaster . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won't have much to offer you . 
neg/cv642_29788.txt so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , " who is corky ? " 
neg/cv642_29788.txt you can simply reply , " who cares ? "
