neg/cv624_11601.txt in the james bond film " diamonds are forever , " tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt well , collars and cuffs don't match in " the real blonde . " 
neg/cv624_11601.txt what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt it plays like an " ally mcbeal " episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary " fantasy " sequences . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt it isn't . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt  " that's not really acting " he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after " showgirls " ) . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt dicillo has referred to " the real blonde " as " off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . " 
neg/cv624_11601.txt the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant " living in oblivion " ) , is at her most annoying in " the real blonde . " 
neg/cv624_11601.txt look at her closely ; she really can't act at all . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a " natural " blonde . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera " passion crest " --stiff and uninteresting . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt maybe that's the point . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 ) . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt why is that ? 
neg/cv624_11601.txt almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt why is that ! ? 
neg/cv624_11601.txt marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt and so on . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt the best parts of the " the real blonde " are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt there's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . 
neg/cv624_11601.txt while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny .

neg/cv314_16095.txt since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama " schindler's list " and directed 1993's intelligent " searching for bobby fischer , " his new film , " a civil action , " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , " a civil action " is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , " a civil action " is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film " the sweet hereafter , " which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt not only was the plotting similar to " a civil action , " but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful " a sweet hereafter " was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt in " a civil action , " however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt you've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what " a civil action " does . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt i could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ? 
neg/cv314_16095.txt since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . 
neg/cv314_16095.txt and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ? 
neg/cv314_16095.txt she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? 
neg/cv314_16095.txt finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? 
neg/cv314_16095.txt abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , " a civil action " seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .

neg/cv088_25274.txt the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself . 
neg/cv088_25274.txt however the difference here is that this one joke just isn't very funny . 
neg/cv088_25274.txt rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home .

neg/cv501_12675.txt

neg/cv501_12675.txt synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt comments : the ex is a very bad movie . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt time and time again , things do not add up in this movie . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states " i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated . " 
neg/cv501_12675.txt or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? 
neg/cv501_12675.txt  ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : " what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? 
neg/cv501_12675.txt oh , that's right . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt 'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' " 
neg/cv501_12675.txt this is what passes for humor in the film . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts " the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! " 
neg/cv501_12675.txt  ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) 
neg/cv501_12675.txt and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! 
neg/cv501_12675.txt molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that " she's crazy . " 
neg/cv501_12675.txt you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it . 
neg/cv501_12675.txt if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn't spend money renting it .

neg/cv949_21565.txt `bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt boy , are these bats ugly . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt in fact , that may have worked out better in the end . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt mccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? 
neg/cv949_21565.txt i just want my money . ' 
neg/cv949_21565.txt the bats are ugly , i must say . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt there's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt let's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? 
neg/cv949_21565.txt you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . 
neg/cv949_21565.txt this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' .

neg/cv708_28539.txt a bleak indie film about a stolen identity . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt it tries to make a heavy-handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment , with their only way out being crime . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean .

neg/cv708_28539.txt matt mahurin is virtual one-man crew in putting this film together ( director/writer /cinematographer/editor ) , who is a still photographer in his day job . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt a white photographer ( robert knepper ) is mugged by a black gang while he's on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt he becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as he's left in a deserted harlem building , as the gang leaves him for dead ; but , one of the muggers , rumor ( michael williams ) , comes back and pretends to help him . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt he's a would-be photographer , who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him what's happening , he becomes the photographer for a few days . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt he enters the photographer's stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera , and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend , stella ( belinda becker ) . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt she's the only one in the film who could act . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . 
neg/cv708_28539.txt it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging .

neg/cv626_7907.txt  " tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! " 
neg/cv626_7907.txt a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : " mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! " . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt ah , but there is dunaway's performance . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt and what a delicious piece of campery it often is . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line " tina ! ! 
neg/cv626_7907.txt fetch me the axe ! ! " 
neg/cv626_7907.txt with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt oh dear ! 
neg/cv626_7907.txt sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ? 
neg/cv626_7907.txt this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : " no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! " . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : " don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! " . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt oh joy ! 
neg/cv626_7907.txt something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . 
neg/cv626_7907.txt great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .

neg/cv808_13773.txt  " mafia ! " - crime isn't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998 
neg/cv808_13773.txt on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as " the godfather , " " goodfellas " and " casino " . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt but by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt  " mafia ! " 
neg/cv808_13773.txt chronicles vincenzo cortino's ( lloyd bridges ) life . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt  " mafia ! " is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as " airplane " and " the naked gun . " 
neg/cv808_13773.txt but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt it's a tough genre to parody . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say " please " as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt a gunman shoots him several times . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt i think that i just gave away the best part of the film . 
neg/cv808_13773.txt oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .

neg/cv106_18379.txt in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . 
neg/cv106_18379.txt however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . 


neg/cv551_11214.txt

neg/cv551_11214.txt kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt she meets nick to propose the plan . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt he accepts . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt or maybe kate does like nick , but " reconciliation " will force her to admit her lies to her employer . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating . " 
neg/cv551_11214.txt quite frankly it's insulting . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt she did a decent enough job in ed burns' " she's the one " because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt her performance was not convincing . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt the film is similar to " my best friends wedding " in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt at least " my best friends wedding " changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt no such luck with " picture perfect " . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
neg/cv551_11214.txt was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
neg/cv551_11214.txt throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
neg/cv551_11214.txt i doubt it . 
neg/cv551_11214.txt and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
neg/cv551_11214.txt are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
neg/cv551_11214.txt well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense .
