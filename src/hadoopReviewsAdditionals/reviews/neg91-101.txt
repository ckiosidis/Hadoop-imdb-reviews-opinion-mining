neg/cv398_17047.txt when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in " jackie brown " , he immediately signed up for a little film called " american perfekt " . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt this was almost two years ago . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt i waited patiently for the film to be released , but it never was . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt finally , i forgot about it . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , " american perfekt " . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee , rushed home to view it . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt  " american perfekt " is a jumbled mess . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt the storyline is non-existent . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt it wants to get by on quirkyness and so-called charm alone , and it just doesn't work . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer , and they head off on the road together . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt along the way to no discernable destination , they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt i suppose this free-wheeling , no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment , but all it did was make me sleepy . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt i'm all for trying new things within the realm of film , but not at the expense of coherence . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt nothing in this movie makes sense . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt the actions of the characters go unexplained , even when they're truly bizarre . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt i'll give you an example , without giving too much away . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt david thewlis has a part as a drifting con-man . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt at one point , mid-way through the movie , he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt as he passes them , we see that his face is covered in blood . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him ? 
neg/cv398_17047.txt you would think so , wouldn't you . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt  " american perfekt " is a waste of time . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt nothing is gained from watching this movie , except maybe a migraine . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt and if you do rent it , don't bother trying to figure out what's going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt this doesn't happen . 
neg/cv398_17047.txt and no explanation is given for the misspelling of " perfect " , either . 


neg/cv998_15691.txt

neg/cv998_15691.txt there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , " halloween , " but he also made 1980's " the fog , " and 1987's underrated , " prince of darkness . " 
neg/cv998_15691.txt heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with " in the mouth of madness . " 
neg/cv998_15691.txt but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , " memoirs of an invisible man . " 
neg/cv998_15691.txt somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , " village of the damned , " to his uninspired 1996 sequel , " escape from l . a . " those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , " john carpenter's vampires . " 
neg/cv998_15691.txt if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , " vampires . " 
neg/cv998_15691.txt the story is simple . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? 
neg/cv998_15691.txt well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt  " john carpenter's vampires , " sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of " pseudo " -clever lines of dialogue . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in " twin peaks " ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , " john carpenter's vamires , " which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt he has said that he turned down directing , " halloween : h20 , " because he couldn't work up any excitement for it . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt and yet , when asked about a " vampires " sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . 
neg/cv998_15691.txt i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . 


neg/cv979_2029.txt

neg/cv979_2029.txt robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil " sheriff of rottingham " . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt a good adventure plot that is sadly unused . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from " rent-a-wreck " ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . 
neg/cv979_2029.txt if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film . 


neg/cv331_8656.txt

neg/cv331_8656.txt the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt the movie . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the " lewis and clark " has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the " event horizon , " gets to come along for the ride . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . " 
neg/cv331_8656.txt well , i don't know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . . . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt you've seen this kind of movie before . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt the sets are beautiful to gaze upon . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt but the final execution is extremely disappointing . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . 
neg/cv331_8656.txt if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us . "

neg/cv648_17277.txt  " there's nothing new under the sun " is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means " let's find something to copy . " 
neg/cv648_17277.txt of course there are very few completely original ideas . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt my understanding of the word " sequel " is a continuation of the story . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ? 
neg/cv648_17277.txt this is your dream come true . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt doors slam shut by themselves . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt glass globes blow up . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt any of this sound familiar ? 
neg/cv648_17277.txt once the audience catches on that this is the same story as " carrie " , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt there are a couple of minor plot differences . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? 
neg/cv648_17277.txt sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a " disease " is never explained . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt blink and you'll miss it . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt  " the rage " retains some of the trappings of " carrie " without the meaning . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original . 
neg/cv648_17277.txt seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one . 


neg/cv128_29444.txt

neg/cv128_29444.txt susan granger's review of " ghosts of mars " ( sony pictures entertainment ) 
neg/cv128_29444.txt horror auteur john carpenter ( " halloween , " " vampires " ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year's " pitch black , " involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt grier , pill-poppin' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch " desolation " williams - that's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt but when they're besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as " vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , " according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the " night of the living dead " -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " ghosts of mars " thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . 
neg/cv128_29444.txt perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : " mission to mars " and " red planet . "

neg/cv139_14236.txt for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) 
neg/cv139_14236.txt snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? 
neg/cv139_14236.txt if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? 
neg/cv139_14236.txt is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? 
neg/cv139_14236.txt will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? 
neg/cv139_14236.txt and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the trailer is a work of sheer genius . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt  ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) 
neg/cv139_14236.txt but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the trailer gives away much , too much of the story . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt de palma is maddeningly inconsistent . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt this is what's called giving the devil his due . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind . 
neg/cv139_14236.txt however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .

neg/cv664_4264.txt warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt  ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt hint : it sounds like splat . ) 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the rest of the film is just more of the same . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? 
neg/cv664_4264.txt writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt the script is virtually devoid of wit . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt tribal mask jokes ? 
neg/cv664_4264.txt jerry lewis cameos ? 
neg/cv664_4264.txt forget it . 
neg/cv664_4264.txt if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge .

neg/cv859_15689.txt

neg/cv859_15689.txt in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , " glory , " but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994's " legends of the fall , " and 1996's " courage under fire . " 
neg/cv859_15689.txt those two films weren't bad , just not very good , but with zwick's latest film , " the siege , " he has finally made one . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt  " the siege , " is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt later , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt there are some movies that simply don't need to be made , and , " the siege " may very well be one of them . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt oh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a " meaningful " action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , " die hard , " which also starred bruce willis . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt this time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt whatever points , " the siege , " earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , " john caprenter's vampires , " by placing them all in the category of " bad guys . " 
neg/cv859_15689.txt  " the siege , " contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt bening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt by the climax of , " the siege , " with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called " message " of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , " on deadly ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment . 
neg/cv859_15689.txt  " the siege " is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay .
