pos/cv983_22928.txt few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams " i'm important ! " 
pos/cv983_22928.txt mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt as he comments , " we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . " 
pos/cv983_22928.txt in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt that's probably because it isn't one . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt these are people . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt this is their story . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt we empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt things pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt  * spoiler warning ! 
pos/cv983_22928.txt skip next paragraph if in suspense ! * 
pos/cv983_22928.txt the film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt what , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? 
pos/cv983_22928.txt his mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt i haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i'm suspicious . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt another thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela's ashes stands tall . 
pos/cv983_22928.txt despite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder .

pos/cv261_10954.txt titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt oh yeah , and the ship sinks . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt firstly , there's cameron's direction . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the audience really does come to hate him . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt a superb film , but sadly not perfect . 
pos/cv261_10954.txt overall rating= (

pos/cv726_4719.txt copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives ! 
pos/cv726_4719.txt sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt henry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices ! 
pos/cv726_4719.txt owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor ! 
pos/cv726_4719.txt it looks like he has some explaining to do ! 
pos/cv726_4719.txt there are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt the film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along . 
pos/cv726_4719.txt however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it . 


pos/cv256_14740.txt

pos/cv256_14740.txt most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt antz , however , has upped the ante considerably . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in 1997 , it was the volcano duel . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt who will prevail ? 
pos/cv256_14740.txt time will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt  " when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . " he comments about his neglected childhood . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but don't be fooled . . . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt it's truly a great example of film making at its finest . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt do they ? ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in fact , it far exceeds that one . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt he played miles on the tv show murphy brown . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt most of it will go over young children's heads . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? 
pos/cv256_14740.txt not at all . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt they will have a lot of fun watching this one . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt what is great is the themes that are given to us . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home . 
pos/cv256_14740.txt have i confused you enough ? 
pos/cv256_14740.txt if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most .

pos/cv146_18458.txt seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
pos/cv146_18458.txt  ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) 
pos/cv146_18458.txt as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
pos/cv146_18458.txt never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt second trilogy . . . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt well you know what i mean ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' 
pos/cv146_18458.txt because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] 
pos/cv146_18458.txt first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt but i digress . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . 
pos/cv146_18458.txt but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .

pos/cv653_19583.txt  " a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . " 
pos/cv653_19583.txt starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong 
pos/cv653_19583.txt eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt he does not seem particularly out of place . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they're american ) --the tokens of his success . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt he loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt but eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt director mabel cheung ( an autumn's tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt on his way to his parent's village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt slim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt that's predictable . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt it's typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt when odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , " it's all the same . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt wherever we go , we'll be in chinatown , " and her straightforward statement expresses much . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt both their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt but they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt such is life . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt slim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt the exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people's lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . 
pos/cv653_19583.txt yes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . 


pos/cv014_13924.txt

pos/cv014_13924.txt the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt it takes a pretty smart person to do that . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
pos/cv014_13924.txt what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
pos/cv014_13924.txt in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
pos/cv014_13924.txt it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , " i hate to do this , but . . . " , 
pos/cv014_13924.txt although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
pos/cv014_13924.txt unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt his is an interesting character . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt  " i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , " he says . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt gray really lucked out with this cast . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . 
pos/cv014_13924.txt both provide some pretty good entertainment .

pos/cv553_26915.txt bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his " powers " and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt writer/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 
pos/cv553_26915.txt for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur ) . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to " exercise " his powers . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt where the film does lose points though , is during its " surprise " ending . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying " that was it ? ! " 
pos/cv553_26915.txt when unbreakable revealed its own ending . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it ) . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt one thing seems clear , though . 
pos/cv553_26915.txt shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . 


pos/cv716_10514.txt

pos/cv716_10514.txt while watching " shallow grave , " i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' " blood simple . " 
pos/cv716_10514.txt both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt both films are also flawed , but for different reasons . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt  " blood simple " is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt  " shallow grave , " on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt a man named hugo moves into the apartment's remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes " shallow grave " so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt while i do not consider myself the " happy endings are automatically stupid " type , i thought that " shallow grave " really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional " caper " ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt granted , this isn't really a " happy " ending , but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt still , " shallow grave " was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . 
pos/cv716_10514.txt i guess i just can't help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away .
