pos/cv870_16348.txt originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt  " talking about love is like dancing about architecture " ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt how do people fall in love ? 
pos/cv870_16348.txt why do people fall out of love ? 
pos/cv870_16348.txt how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
pos/cv870_16348.txt all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt meet a hip , young couple going through their first date . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt a married woman " finding herself " while cheating on her husband . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt a husband letting go of his inhibitions . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt an older couple dealing with a past " love " of the man , a secret recently uncovered . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt some related to the younger couples' issues . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt others with the married . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt the actors in this film are all also very , very good . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much . 
pos/cv870_16348.txt on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same .

pos/cv718_11434.txt usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug , but not the big lebowski . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt the new offering from the creators of 1996's critical hit fargo , is to say the least , wildly entertaining . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother's movies , and the big lebowski is insanely original . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt it begins oddly enough when jeff " the dude " lebowski ( jeff bridges ) is mistaken for a millionaire , jeff " the big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) , who's wife , bunny ( tara reid ) owes money all over town . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt two goons , out to collect on bunny's debt break into dude's house . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team ( steve buscemi & john goodman , respectively . ) 
pos/cv718_11434.txt he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt he does this , and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt also several great supporting roles , john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt the coen's script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo , but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 . 
pos/cv718_11434.txt if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one , if not they give this one a try its a little different . 


pos/cv512_15965.txt

pos/cv512_15965.txt it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt it's been said that todd haynes' " velvet goldmine , " the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from " citizen kane , " and that's true . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt structure-wise , this totally steals from " kane , " not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt this is no " kane , " and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like " kane " did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , " baby's on fire , " with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt with brian eno's famous " needle in the camel's eye " playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being " style over substance , " a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the music is especially notable . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a " poof " ) never help us communicate with him . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt as a cultural rock piece , " velvet goldmine " is rather good , but it is merely good . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? 
pos/cv512_15965.txt it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt still , it does what the oliver stone pic " the doors " didn't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : " live life , but after you've lived it , what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? " ) . 
pos/cv512_15965.txt the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . 


pos/cv953_6836.txt

pos/cv953_6836.txt books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
pos/cv953_6836.txt in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and 
pos/cv953_6836.txt it's about to do so again . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html 
pos/cv953_6836.txt or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ 
pos/cv953_6836.txt  ) . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt pictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even 
pos/cv953_6836.txt months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt the negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt and _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt it's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt even letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt in regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt go and see it more than once . . . it 
pos/cv953_6836.txt may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt take along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt there's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . 
pos/cv953_6836.txt let's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . 


pos/cv093_13951.txt

pos/cv093_13951.txt  " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt so why did i enjoy it so much ? 
pos/cv093_13951.txt for one thing , the cast is great . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt and he never broods . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt the rest of the cast is equally impressive . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . 
pos/cv093_13951.txt another nice touch is the music .

pos/cv746_10147.txt  ( dimension films , " scream 2 " 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first ) . ) 
pos/cv746_10147.txt  " the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , " said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller " scream , " her statement referring to the films of the " nightmare on elm street " series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt but like it or not , along comes " scream 2 . " and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt  " scream 2 " is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called " stab . " 
pos/cv746_10147.txt and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during " scream , " has left his job as a police officer for a while . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt life is tranquil . . . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt at least for a while . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? 
pos/cv746_10147.txt like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of " stab , " making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from " stab " which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt  ( " b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! " 
pos/cv746_10147.txt pinkett yells at the screen . ) 
pos/cv746_10147.txt it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original " scream " gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like " the usual suspects , " " aliens " and " the empire strikes back . " 
pos/cv746_10147.txt still , " scream 2 " does so many things right , it's petty to quibble . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt the attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt and the denouement ( while not as shocking as " scream " 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in " scream " with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt all this and a " scream 3 " is in the works . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt knowing the series' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . 
pos/cv746_10147.txt mentioning " scream 2 " 'll help them in their argument .

pos/cv110_27788.txt plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! 
pos/cv110_27788.txt it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 
pos/cv110_27788.txt a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks ! 
pos/cv110_27788.txt there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? 
pos/cv110_27788.txt no . . . okay , 
pos/cv110_27788.txt well i just did ! 
pos/cv110_27788.txt i coulda done without her whole " romance " angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt try to see how many " inside " connections to the king you can guess . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt i also like these types of " guy " movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt the elvis songs also recommend this movie ! 
pos/cv110_27788.txt so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt it's now or never , folks . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . 
pos/cv110_27788.txt thank you . . . thank 
pos/cv110_27788.txt you very much ! !

pos/cv877_29274.txt susan granger's review of " bread and tulips " ( first look pictures ) 
pos/cv877_29274.txt in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt for the first time in years , rosalba's on her own when she's abandoned at a highway rest area . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing-supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she's never visited . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt film-maker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle-aged , middle-class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low-key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage-therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber-turned-private eye who's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house . 
pos/cv877_29274.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " bread and tulips " is a beguiling , escapist 8 .

pos/cv688_7368.txt time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt this map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt the supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt during the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt but , according to randall , they are just " borrowing " it . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt kevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt their first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt from here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt eventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt kevin accidentally saved the king's life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic .

pos/cv688_7368.txt time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . 
pos/cv688_7368.txt with a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone .

pos/cv120_4111.txt

pos/cv120_4111.txt in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt go see it ! 
pos/cv120_4111.txt so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt  " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt  ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) 
pos/cv120_4111.txt smart's got a point . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' 
pos/cv120_4111.txt of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt  " you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . " 
pos/cv120_4111.txt her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! 
pos/cv120_4111.txt to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt rated r - for language and mature themes . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt  ( respect the r , not for under 14's ) rating ----- stars . 
pos/cv120_4111.txt go see it .
