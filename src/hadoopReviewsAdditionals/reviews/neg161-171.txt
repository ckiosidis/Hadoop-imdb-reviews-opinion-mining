neg/cv126_28821.txt plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt kewl . . . now 
neg/cv126_28821.txt i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . . . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone's talent . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt how julia roberts is used solely as a " puppy dog " character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a " romantic comedy " ) , is also beyond me . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt and to anybody who decided that this project was " funny " enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci . . . well , 
neg/cv126_28821.txt what can i say . . . i 
neg/cv126_28821.txt just don't have the words . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt so is this the worst movie that i've seen all year ? 
neg/cv126_28821.txt no . but it definitely sucks and it's basically because . . . well , 
neg/cv126_28821.txt it's just not funny . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . . waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt and then hank azaria shows up . . . aaaaaah , the film's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that's another story altogether ) . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt but when an experienced " voice " actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer " blockbuster " romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude . . . your 
neg/cv126_28821.txt film's in trouble ! ! 
neg/cv126_28821.txt rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he's going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well . . . i 
neg/cv126_28821.txt could go on . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt but i won't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci's antics from time to time ( ironic , eh . . . what 
neg/cv126_28821.txt about the leads , dammit ! ) and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course ) . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt a dud all the way around . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then . . . well , 
neg/cv126_28821.txt it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit ! 
neg/cv126_28821.txt ugh . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt i think i'm gonna start drinking again after this lame-ass movie . 
neg/cv126_28821.txt c'mon hollywood , enough with the crud !

neg/cv463_10846.txt

neg/cv463_10846.txt synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt she drugs someone . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches " f--k you , you b-----d " and throws a phone . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either . 
neg/cv463_10846.txt feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . 


neg/cv785_23748.txt

neg/cv785_23748.txt for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt despite it's lurid subject matter and it's passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt they have a beautiful house in suburbia . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt in an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt this is a couple that has it all . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt into this eden slithers the lure of lust . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt despite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine's concerns . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine's dismay . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt as jermaine puts it , " don't you want to be sexually free ? " 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt the woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jade , at one point was a college student , too . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt unlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt to further reinforce their differences , it's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt inevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine's part , the forbidden act is consummated . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine's property with the hint that the violence may escalate . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt by this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jasmine is bland and subservient . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt jade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt yet another tale of a sexually aggressive " dog " of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? 
neg/cv785_23748.txt if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . 
neg/cv785_23748.txt as it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . 


neg/cv517_20616.txt

neg/cv517_20616.txt you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such " classics " as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so " good " at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case , this is a failure . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt ricci , for example , plays a prostitute . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? 
neg/cv517_20616.txt zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt it's desperately unfunny , but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . 
neg/cv517_20616.txt i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off .

neg/cv222_18720.txt

neg/cv222_18720.txt synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt comments : this movie was boring . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt plain and simple . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt entrapment should not have been boring . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current " hot topic " in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt so , what went wrong ? 
neg/cv222_18720.txt plenty , unfortunately . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the major problem with entrapment is its script . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt it has a been-there , done-that feel to it . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt  " 4 days to the millennium " ) . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth " surprise " revelation is made . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt entrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt sean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as " never trust a naked woman . " 
neg/cv222_18720.txt ving rhames' character seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt the tagline for this movie reads " the trap is set . " 
neg/cv222_18720.txt it sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt entrapment really isn't that bad ; it is watchable . 
neg/cv222_18720.txt i would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it . 


neg/cv650_15974.txt

neg/cv650_15974.txt the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . 
neg/cv650_15974.txt but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average . 


neg/cv193_5393.txt

neg/cv193_5393.txt young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn't stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt personally , i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt although yahoo's performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the " 1812 overture " and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . 
neg/cv193_5393.txt in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn't raise any eyebrows . 


neg/cv705_11973.txt

neg/cv705_11973.txt i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . 
neg/cv705_11973.txt mind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . 
neg/cv705_11973.txt i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream's . 
neg/cv705_11973.txt as a result , it's even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it's about thirty times smarter than it is . 
neg/cv705_11973.txt based on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . 
neg/cv705_11973.txt the appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90's ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town .

neg/cv316_5972.txt i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' " i will dare " on the car radio . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt unfortunately , you would be dead wrong . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . 
neg/cv316_5972.txt feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that . 


neg/cv874_12182.txt

neg/cv874_12182.txt  " tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like " heaven's gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? 
neg/cv874_12182.txt of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes " ) down to the really bad ( 1981's " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt  " greystoke " added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt  " tarzan and the lost city , " on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt comic books have better plots than this . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy " george of the jungle . " 
neg/cv874_12182.txt didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? 
neg/cv874_12182.txt the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from " raiders of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the goonies " ( 1985 ) . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt of course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? 
neg/cv874_12182.txt strictly speaking , " tarzan and the lost city " isn't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt this movie proves what " starship troopers " only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt waddington makes a decent villain , although he's like a charmless version of belloq from " raiders of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt  " tarzan and the lost city " is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . 
neg/cv874_12182.txt so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .
