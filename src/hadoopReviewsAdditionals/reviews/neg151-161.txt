neg/cv862_15924.txt the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly " magical " piece of work ? 
neg/cv862_15924.txt a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded " city " , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt here is where the film took a wrong turn . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget's full cavity search at the airport . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt another problem i found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt if you're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . 
neg/cv862_15924.txt but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? 
neg/cv862_15924.txt it just didn't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie .

neg/cv900_10800.txt there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse 
neg/cv900_10800.txt me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt and up go the lights . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt he looks at another character . . . and 
neg/cv900_10800.txt winks . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . 
neg/cv900_10800.txt just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . 


neg/cv778_18629.txt

neg/cv778_18629.txt david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt lost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt david spade is not the problem with lost and found . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt he plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt the story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt dylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt and so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt there are three good things about lost and found . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt the first is spade . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt lastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt unfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt this kind of physical humor is dead . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt this is where i start to get fuzzy . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? 
neg/cv778_18629.txt predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt there are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt despite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work . 
neg/cv778_18629.txt if you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present .

neg/cv276_17126.txt  * * the following review contains spoilers * * 
neg/cv276_17126.txt  " please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . " 
neg/cv276_17126.txt -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 
neg/cv276_17126.txt i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt apparently , no one heard my words . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt oh , how i wish you had heard them . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt because he's done it again . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the choice of casting does the film in . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt so your first instinct has now been confirmed . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous " since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing " moments ) . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt huh ? 
neg/cv276_17126.txt also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! 
neg/cv276_17126.txt the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! 
neg/cv276_17126.txt it's totally absurd . . . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt and this is the screenwriter of seven ? 
neg/cv276_17126.txt late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of " suspense " . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt go around to the other side of the car ! ! 
neg/cv276_17126.txt this goes on for minutes . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! 
neg/cv276_17126.txt we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt awful decision there joel . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt another is cage's performance . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt you're capable of much better mr . cage . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt now as for you mr . schumacher . . . 
neg/cv276_17126.txt i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

neg/cv502_10970.txt

neg/cv502_10970.txt the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt finally , there's buster ( j . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it 
neg/cv502_10970.txt seems to be almost a clone of the original . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 
neg/cv502_10970.txt well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt there are plenty of recurring characters too . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt and what's the deal with the orphan ? 
neg/cv502_10970.txt it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt it's a shame . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt buy the soundtrack and avoid the film . 
neg/cv502_10970.txt better yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll 
neg/cv502_10970.txt have a much better time . 


neg/cv842_5702.txt

neg/cv842_5702.txt according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors " hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . " 
neg/cv842_5702.txt hmm . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt you never know , they just might be on to something . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's . . . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt dumb and dumber . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? 
neg/cv842_5702.txt why two of these ? 
neg/cv842_5702.txt why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? 
neg/cv842_5702.txt the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , " wouldn't that be funny ? " . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt well , no , actually . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt the actors don't do the movie much favours either . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please

neg/cv842_5702.txt even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . 
neg/cv842_5702.txt we'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( " strictly bowling " , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy .

neg/cv347_14722.txt if you have ever seen fox tv's special car chase programs , you'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action " thriller " from director john frankenheimer . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show's natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt dierdre's groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless script . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt don't get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here . 
neg/cv347_14722.txt we never do find out what's in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller . 


neg/cv405_21868.txt

neg/cv405_21868.txt arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? 
neg/cv405_21868.txt once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! 
neg/cv405_21868.txt parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt i'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt speaking of action , where was it in this film ? 
neg/cv405_21868.txt there was hardly any explosions or fights . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt i also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt do they even read these things anymore ? 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it sure doesn't seem like it . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt thankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt the guy is creepy looking anyway ! 
neg/cv405_21868.txt when it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt don't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt it's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . 
neg/cv405_21868.txt save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . 


neg/cv521_1730.txt

neg/cv521_1730.txt saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn't too impressed . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt sound cliche ? 
neg/cv521_1730.txt that's only the beginning . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt then he goes " crazy " from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt but it didn't all come together . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt there was very little logical development in these characters . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt my biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt they began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the " real life " feel of covert operations in panama . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt many have seen the slowed down " bullet-cam " following the projectile to its target . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt it was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but 
neg/cv521_1730.txt it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then 
neg/cv521_1730.txt it just seemed silly . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt all in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . 
neg/cv521_1730.txt but the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn't form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics . 


neg/cv293_29731.txt

neg/cv293_29731.txt alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt perhaps the musketeer , a new film that " reimagines " the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt it's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt this time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can't even pronounce his character's name . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt he vowed to have vengeance . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal's own guards . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt together with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt oh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt just thought i'd mention that . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt now , look : i don't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt i have nothing against " modernizing " classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt when the musketeers finally get to holler " all for one , and one for all , " i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt it's as though anything that may have been construed as " fun " was purposely expunged from the production . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt the joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt chambers can't act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren't given the chance . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt and when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt some movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . 
neg/cv293_29731.txt the film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time .
