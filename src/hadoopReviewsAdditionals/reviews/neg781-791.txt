neg/cv923_11951.txt the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an " r " -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as " erotic . " 
neg/cv923_11951.txt i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt this creature , dubbed " eve " by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt his intention is obviously world domination . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there's no damping his ardor . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt i'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- " underused " is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( " invisible " would be more like it ) . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt meanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt do i recommend the movie ? 
neg/cv923_11951.txt absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . 
neg/cv923_11951.txt here's hoping there's no species 3 .

neg/cv825_5168.txt if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80's , they'd agree d . c . cab is the quintessential " usa up all nite " movie . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt it's one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can't see until it's edited for tv . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt it's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt and , strike three , it pairs mr . t with gary busey . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt i heard gilbert say d . c . cab had " an all-star cast , " but i'm still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt when third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara " as herself , " you can't say a damn thing about all-star casts . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt likewise for token appearances by marsha " roz " warfield , paul rodriguez and " politically incorrect " host bill maher , before he was somebody . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt appearing in d . c . cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene " i'm gonna live forever " cara . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt d . c . cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the " token white guy " ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word " honkey " as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt we've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt some are fun to watch and some are actually funny . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt this one is more or less neither . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt you'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt it's a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality . 
neg/cv825_5168.txt d . c . cab has rightly earned its position on " usa up all nite . "

neg/cv971_11790.txt as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt  ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt and she's right , it is that bad . ) 
neg/cv971_11790.txt directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt but who's counting ? 
neg/cv971_11790.txt and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes " your geyser's a geezer , " and " i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . " 
neg/cv971_11790.txt as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as " a walking kodak moment , " are celebrating their 18th birthday . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt  " how could this possibly be worst , " asks phil . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt after phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . 
neg/cv971_11790.txt nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .

neg/cv384_18536.txt it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt and no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt really , i don't . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt not at all . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? 
neg/cv384_18536.txt in the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt their purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt this is the love letter's damning error . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt capshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt even worse -- it's a bore . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt but it's far from profound . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt there isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt really , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt but bad , it is . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt awful , it also is . 
neg/cv384_18536.txt the love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that .

neg/cv491_12992.txt that's " dirty work " in a nutshell . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt a very different kind of movie . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt this is not a movie that i can easily review . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt  . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt  . and 
neg/cv491_12992.txt tells me this movie is terrible . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt it's a one note concept . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients .

neg/cv491_12992.txt first the critic in me . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt here's the catch . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt none of the characters are sympathetic . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt there's jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt there's even a subplot that's developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt and i loved watching it . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt norm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don't understand . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt how do they get out of it ? 
neg/cv491_12992.txt by admiting they lied on their resumes , and don't know a thing about construction ! 
neg/cv491_12992.txt and surprise , they get fired . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the characters are incredibly mean-spirited .

neg/cv491_12992.txt the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt and then there's mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt  " too bad we have to do it , " mitch says . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt and that's the way it should be . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) . 
neg/cv491_12992.txt i just couldn't stop laughing .

neg/cv183_19826.txt unfortunately for us , a big bore ! 
neg/cv183_19826.txt plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt critique : this movie just didn't scare me one bit . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt well , this film didn't do much for me . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt and they might as well have called it the " haunting of lily taylor " , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt don't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard " comic relief " , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt it's all too sad , cause certainly the " idea " seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ? 
neg/cv183_19826.txt well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry . 
neg/cv183_19826.txt see it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining .

neg/cv355_18174.txt bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
neg/cv355_18174.txt the odd couple ii 
neg/cv355_18174.txt grumpy old men , it ain't . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt hell , my fellow americans , it ain't . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt odd couple ii feels terribly generic , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt that's like repackaging campbell's soup in a generic food can , really . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt how writer neil simon could've made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt throughout the movie , i really didn't laugh once . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt honestly . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn't seem funny to me . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt and that car rolling off the cliff ? 
neg/cv355_18174.txt the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt and the ending gets all super-mushy , too . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a wasted jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon's daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i'm sure . 
neg/cv355_18174.txt consider it a hospitable gester , you won't waste your time renting this muck .

neg/cv072_5928.txt  " there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? 
neg/cv072_5928.txt true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt of course , it doesn't . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt  ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) 
neg/cv072_5928.txt so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt even the soundtrack is tired . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . 
neg/cv072_5928.txt who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ? 
neg/cv072_5928.txt the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .

neg/cv745_14009.txt conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt and for the most part they're messing it up . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt  " mission impossible " , " lost in space " , " godzilla " , " zorro " . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt none of these successfully capture the originals . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt none of these are even good films . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt you can now add " the avengers " to the list . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the british television series began in 1961 . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without " appeal " . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt now we're in the nineties . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt that's about as much of a plot as we have . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt we get betrayal for some unknown reason . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason .

neg/cv745_14009.txt least in some scenes . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt macnee makes an appearance of sorts . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt it feels like major portions of the film are missing . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the storyline jumps rather than flows . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt reportedly the film was re-cut several times . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt other than that , the effects are second-rate . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt fiennes fares even less well . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the action scenes are difficult to follow . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of " diabolique " ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there's no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt one of emma peel's first lines of dialog is " rules are made to be broken . " 
neg/cv745_14009.txt it doesn't get any better . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt the release date was changed several times . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt connery refuses to promote the film . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt admittedly i haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt my guess is that it would be severely dated now . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt no matter how antiquated it might be , there's no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt there's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie . 
neg/cv745_14009.txt no reason at all .
