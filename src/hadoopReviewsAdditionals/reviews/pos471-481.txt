pos/cv408_5297.txt it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt he had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series' theme , which is missing in the movie ) " bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space " , and is monitoring nelson's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester's sidekick , tv's frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt for their big screen outing , the producers have chosen " this island earth " , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt unfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today's standards , are less than impressive . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan's dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle's kingdome , and most of them work . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt unfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite's movie theater seem out of place and aren't particularly funny , but at least they're fairly short . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt the big question about this movie though is : why ? 
pos/cv408_5297.txt i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt so , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt nevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you're going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . 
pos/cv408_5297.txt given its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of " unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies " it does well . 


pos/cv994_12270.txt

pos/cv994_12270.txt a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark's migration from the " good vibrations " and " calvin klein undie ad " guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt boy likes girl . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt girl likes boy . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt boy and girl begin dating . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt girl steps to boy's defense . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt family problems occur . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt girl learns more about the boy . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt boy goes nuts . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt fun ensues . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? 
pos/cv994_12270.txt well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as " best villain " at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if 
pos/cv994_12270.txt you're into that kind of thing , that is : ) . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt i didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt then again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the " big deal " was about his daughter dating david . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt his reply : " the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . " 
pos/cv994_12270.txt good point . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt all in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt mind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt and on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! 
pos/cv994_12270.txt another firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! 
pos/cv994_12270.txt little known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt mark wahlberg stands 5 " 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . 
pos/cv994_12270.txt he is also testing the waters on the acting front . 


pos/cv559_0050.txt

pos/cv559_0050.txt every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars " sur-prise ! " 
pos/cv559_0050.txt into my bewildered visage . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt it's almost always a surprise . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt it sure as niflheim was this time . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a " boy , i wish that could happen " sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt another e . t . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt another short circuit . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt this is a very sturdy scenario . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the " yeah , but in real life , this would have happen " thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! 
pos/cv559_0050.txt astounding ! 
pos/cv559_0050.txt he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! 
pos/cv559_0050.txt i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , " amazing " grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness . 
pos/cv559_0050.txt special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is 


pos/cv055_8338.txt

pos/cv055_8338.txt i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt he provided a fantastic performance . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt he also seems obsessed and in love with her . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt for instance , the meaning of the book " the catcher in the rye " and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . 
pos/cv055_8338.txt and even if you aren't , you should still like this film . 


pos/cv223_29066.txt

pos/cv223_29066.txt because the press screening of " planet of the apes " was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? 
pos/cv223_29066.txt this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated " mars attacks ! " 
pos/cv223_29066.txt  ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage " mars attacks ! " 
pos/cv223_29066.txt trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt he doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt the 1968 " apes " boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt the 2001 " planet of the apes " offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . 
pos/cv223_29066.txt it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about . 


pos/cv813_6534.txt

pos/cv813_6534.txt mars attacks ! 
pos/cv813_6534.txt  ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt this is director tim burton's finest film to date . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt the plot is simple : martians invade the earth . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt but it's different than any other invasion film . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt usually it's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt this time however , it's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i've seen in a long time . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt and about the special effects . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt the effects in mars attacks ! 
pos/cv813_6534.txt are just about the most flawless ones i've seen to date . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt there are just a couple of scenes that don't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt could it have been funnier ? 
pos/cv813_6534.txt certainly . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt was it funny enough ? 
pos/cv813_6534.txt yes . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt was i entertained ? 
pos/cv813_6534.txt absolutely . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt on a personal note , i'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt while he's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue . 
pos/cv813_6534.txt the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him . 


pos/cv505_12090.txt

pos/cv505_12090.txt some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt it's rare that a movie with the moniker " based on the life of ? " comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt however , although la motta is credited as the movie's " consultant , " he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt sex and violence are inextricably linked . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt  ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : " are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? " ) 
pos/cv505_12090.txt in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt raging bull is the other side of rocky . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt how many actors would go that far ? 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few " home movie " segments are in color ) . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt  ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) 
pos/cv505_12090.txt in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt after that , his career was all downhill . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ? 
pos/cv505_12090.txt  ( " i coulda been a contenda . " ) 
pos/cv505_12090.txt perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s . 
pos/cv505_12090.txt and , if not , it's certainly perilously close to the zenith .

pos/cv574_22156.txt  " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute .

pos/cv574_22156.txt though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip .

pos/cv574_22156.txt he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate .

pos/cv574_22156.txt with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " is sometimes like last years hit " there's something about mary " that is offensive but very funny .

pos/cv574_22156.txt the characters in the film are all actually likable especially " jabba lady " with her big body but soft heart .

pos/cv574_22156.txt even though i thought " toy story 2 " and " being john malkovich " were the funniest of the year " deuce bigalow " follows right behind them . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate ( arija bareikis ) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt  " deuce bigalow " is a good-natured film worth all the merit it can get . 
pos/cv574_22156.txt its not a classic or a masterpiece , it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching .

pos/cv199_9629.txt

pos/cv199_9629.txt this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
pos/cv199_9629.txt my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt rose is to be wed to a man she does not love . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with " new money " who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt she is a pleasure to see on screen . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the effects are tremendous . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt titanic runs far too long . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's 
pos/cv199_9629.txt not a bad as i am making it out to be . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it really is an exceptionaly well-made film . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt cameron has certainly made his best film to date . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it just doesn't have a strong supporting story . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt it is a film worth seeing . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt i give titanic 3 stars ( . 
pos/cv199_9629.txt that's not bad .

pos/cv748_12786.txt

pos/cv748_12786.txt a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , " the film of the decade ! " 
pos/cv748_12786.txt and " a breakthrough ! " 
pos/cv748_12786.txt can only be leading up to letdown . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life , that you'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , " eh . . . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt  * that's * what all the fuss was about ? " 
pos/cv748_12786.txt so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt and i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt let me tell you , that is an impossibilty . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt the truman show is truly " the film of the decade " and " a breakthrough " and more . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt and you will come out changed on the other side . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt jim carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood's leading men . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the " truman show's " run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the " real " truman show is clever and well-done . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt people , rejoice ! 
pos/cv748_12786.txt this is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt not since " schindler's list " has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt this is a classic in the making , and ( to borrow a line from esquire's review ) it stars jim carrey . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt for , as i said , this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt forget special-effect ladden summer fodder . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt drop your romantic comedies in the trash . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt you need nothing more than " the truman show " to carry you through the summer , or for that matter , the year . 
pos/cv748_12786.txt oh ! and in case i don't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight .
