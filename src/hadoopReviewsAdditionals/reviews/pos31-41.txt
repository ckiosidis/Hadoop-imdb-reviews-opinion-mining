pos/cv067_19774.txt you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt  ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) 
pos/cv067_19774.txt it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . 
pos/cv067_19774.txt i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .

pos/cv284_19119.txt  " you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! " 
pos/cv284_19119.txt okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his " father , " which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt just fill in the blanks ! 
pos/cv284_19119.txt can you see it ? 
pos/cv284_19119.txt  " now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have 
pos/cv284_19119.txt we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 
pos/cv284_19119.txt well , there we go ! " 
pos/cv284_19119.txt of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory " you tarzan , me jane " scene . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt thankfully , those aren't the exact words . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt how does he tell his name to another ape ? 
pos/cv284_19119.txt  " ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? " 
pos/cv284_19119.txt well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt but hey , tarzan's a young adult . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 
pos/cv284_19119.txt isn't that illegal in most countries ? 
pos/cv284_19119.txt oh , well . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's " extreme tarzan . " 
pos/cv284_19119.txt however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its " chandelier scene , " which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , " that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . " 
pos/cv284_19119.txt distracting to say the least . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan of the apes , " so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . 
pos/cv284_19119.txt 'nuff said . 


pos/cv741_11890.txt

pos/cv741_11890.txt those print and television ads trumpeting that " 'grease' is still the word " are right on the money . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt to celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like " star wars " -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt that's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? 
pos/cv741_11890.txt or the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to " be an athletic supporter " by rooting for the home team ? 
pos/cv741_11890.txt or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- " empty nest " dinah manhoff ) ? 
pos/cv741_11890.txt and these are all probably considered minor moments . . . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom's most effervescently charming . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt for those eight of you who aren't familiar with the story , here's a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of " greased lightening , " the film's big " guy " number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but " grease " 's flaws amount too few to carp . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt the movie's first showpiece is " summer nights , " where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt not only is " nights " tremendously catchy , but it's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of " you're the one that i want " and " we go together , " " grease " 's euphoric cappers . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated " hopelessly devoted to you " is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing's lamenting ballad " there are worse things i could do " is one of " grease " 's most unjustly overlooked tunes . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of " nights " ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt and it's a testament to " grease " 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it's the same all-around blast it's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt to '90s viewers , " grease " will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . 
pos/cv741_11890.txt but regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , " grease " is still the word .

pos/cv217_28842.txt susan granger's review of " big eden " ( jour de fete ) 
pos/cv217_28842.txt it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like " welcome to my world " and " achin' , breakin' heart " to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular ! 
pos/cv217_28842.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " big eden " is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 . 
pos/cv217_28842.txt it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end . 


pos/cv147_21193.txt

pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , " can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? " 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are " him " and " her " ( during the bad times ) , and when they are " us " ( during the good times ) . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt where to start about michelle pfeiffer ? 
pos/cv147_21193.txt pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like " it's over , " or " i hate you , " you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an " us . " 
pos/cv147_21193.txt the bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . 
pos/cv147_21193.txt one of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .

pos/cv245_8569.txt as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt an opening prologue in shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt the dance school in shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt it's a delicate performance with a huge heart . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt it is here that shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together . 
pos/cv245_8569.txt that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? 
pos/cv245_8569.txt conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt .

pos/cv749_17765.txt a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .

pos/cv749_17765.txt her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; 
pos/cv749_17765.txt pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt but i digress . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt yet entertain me it did . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . 
pos/cv749_17765.txt unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

pos/cv114_18398.txt it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt there is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt so what are the lessons learnt : 1 . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt don't take your children to class reunions . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt 2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . 
pos/cv114_18398.txt lastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind . 


pos/cv056_13133.txt

pos/cv056_13133.txt the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt  " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt bob's your uncle ! 
pos/cv056_13133.txt better make that walt's your uncle . . . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt kids will no doubt go ga-ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt maybe an animated feature without--shock ! 
pos/cv056_13133.txt horror ! --the 
pos/cv056_13133.txt songs , for example ? 
pos/cv056_13133.txt or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? 
pos/cv056_13133.txt how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? 
pos/cv056_13133.txt it isn't gonna happen . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt like disney's previous entries , " mulan " is slow to make its mark . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( " i'll make a man out of you , " penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . 
pos/cv056_13133.txt she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time . 


pos/cv497_26980.txt

pos/cv497_26980.txt there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt  " lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt much like " fargo , " this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , " dale the thug " ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt where as " fargo " was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , " lucky numbers " is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on " friends . " 
pos/cv497_26980.txt here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt like " jackie brown , " ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt the ending itself is great . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . 
pos/cv497_26980.txt i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?
