neg/cv980_11851.txt with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) 
neg/cv980_11851.txt they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the actors and directing don't help , either . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the writing doesn't help much , either . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt practically every line is just stating the obvious . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt none of it is smart . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt also , where the hell did the budget go ? 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt finally , the film has no idea what genre to be . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt levison can't handle his own plot . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) 
neg/cv980_11851.txt it's not all that bad though . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . 
neg/cv980_11851.txt not really worth seeing .

neg/cv144_5010.txt

neg/cv144_5010.txt dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one " dead bore . " 
neg/cv144_5010.txt in the film , johnson plays . . . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt you guessed it . . . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt a cop . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on " miami vice . " 
neg/cv144_5010.txt a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt she will not even allow him to wish them " merry christmas " by telephone . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the plot is incoherent and full of holes . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( " wkrp in cincinnati " and " frank's place " ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt i guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . 
neg/cv144_5010.txt but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . 


neg/cv084_15183.txt

neg/cv084_15183.txt brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) 
neg/cv084_15183.txt an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt however , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long , and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt the problem is that de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it's no use . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt yes , another problem with the film is that there's no-one to root for . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt we're supposed to be on cage's side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt however , his change is sadly unbelievable . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt poor gary sinise's character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt the film's use of flashback quickly gets boring . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt they certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt the script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt there's a good story buried in snake eyes , it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . 
neg/cv084_15183.txt while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy 'number cruncher' wrapped up in the case , there's no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided .

neg/cv258_5627.txt

neg/cv258_5627.txt the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt i thought stripes would be different . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition " dear god ! " 
neg/cv258_5627.txt every few seconds . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the " aunt jemima treatment , " which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt  " i'm not enjoying this , " the woman protests . 
neg/cv258_5627.txt my sentiments exactly .

neg/cv440_16891.txt the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt jeez .

neg/cv440_16891.txt that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ? 
neg/cv440_16891.txt the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt i was not alone . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . 
neg/cv440_16891.txt producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon . 


neg/cv539_21865.txt

neg/cv539_21865.txt well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt in a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt eraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt batman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt now in 1999 , " end of days " ( not " the end of days " ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt is this the end of a powerful action star's long-lived career ? 
neg/cv539_21865.txt will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( " terminator " , " terminator 2 : judgement day " , " predator " ) ? 
neg/cv539_21865.txt or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( " commando " , " red sonja " , " true lies " ) ? 
neg/cv539_21865.txt it doesn't look that way . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt  " end of days " begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan's baby the hour before new year's of 2000 . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt fortunately for the movie's sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt it's an action film's dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt imagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt arnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt jericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt he shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; " you are a @#$^% ! & 
neg/cv539_21865.txt choir boy ! 
neg/cv539_21865.txt you are a choir boy ! " 
neg/cv539_21865.txt those two lines marked the high points of this film . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt  " end of days " fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt byrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt the annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt kevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan's baby with extreme annoyance . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt in one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt is this her job in the film ? 
neg/cv539_21865.txt the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt in a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt but without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . 
neg/cv539_21865.txt this film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted " you are a ! $@^@ * ^ 
neg/cv539_21865.txt choir boy ! ! " 
neg/cv539_21865.txt for two hours .

neg/cv522_5418.txt an 18-foot-high , 43-foot-long dragon is the computer-generated co- star of this strictly-by-the-numbers sword 'n' sorcery flick . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt as voiced by sean connery , " draco " is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well-deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt he walks , talks , flies , fries , and even fakes his own death , all with the help of 96 computer-aided animators . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt too bad that ilm ( industrial light and magic ) couldn't spare some special effects for dragonheart's * human * co-stars . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt he's a near-total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt david thewlis' evil king has a high hiss factor ( hf ) , though he's more of a mumbling oddity than anything else . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt oh , and there's some redhead in a '90's wig , who runs around either screaming or scowling , depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions , julie christie ( ! ) as the good queen mother , a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy-metal concert , and , believe or it not , the speaking spirit of king arthur .

neg/cv522_5418.txt dragonheart is , well , too much of too little . 
neg/cv522_5418.txt director rob cohen ( dragon : the bruce lee story ) has made a big , expensive movie that , while ambitiously plotted , is both murky and predictable .

neg/cv821_29283.txt it's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of " award-winning " tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt that said , hayes's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt gyllenhall's sweet-natured delivery of jimmy's hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt his mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called " bright 'n shiny , " led by the inimitable fabio . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt unfortunately , a few giggles can't make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt honestly , it's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i'm not just saying that because it's so mediocre . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn't seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney's wondering the same thing . 
neg/cv821_29283.txt hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .

neg/cv148_18084.txt i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt now , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt the result is that the entire production feels contrived . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between " entrapment " and " blackmail " . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt well , you'd be wrong . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? 
neg/cv148_18084.txt i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . 
neg/cv148_18084.txt i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? " 
neg/cv148_18084.txt we know jon , it's called editing . 


neg/cv834_23192.txt

neg/cv834_23192.txt  " meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , " 
neg/cv834_23192.txt screams the television ads for " hanging up , " disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt make me laugh again ! 
neg/cv834_23192.txt not only is " hanging up " misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt and we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? 
neg/cv834_23192.txt excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt while eve's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up's and down's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , " georgia , " while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt interestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt maddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt and they talk . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt and talk . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt and talk . . . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt in fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt if you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt the question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? 
neg/cv834_23192.txt how could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? 
neg/cv834_23192.txt issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt and when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt you can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt you think to yourself : " the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , " and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt meg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998's " hurlyburly " or 1994's " when a man loves a woman " ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt with " hanging up , " the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt diane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt what is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan's senior . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt yeah , right . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt lastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999's " analyze this . " 
neg/cv834_23192.txt kudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt if anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998's " the opposite of sex . " 
neg/cv834_23192.txt if you are a fan of kudrow's ( and who isn't ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than " hanging up " does in its entirety . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt as eve's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt cloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt nearly all the emotions displayed within " hanging up " are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? 
neg/cv834_23192.txt if , for some bizarre , " twilight zone " -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over . 
neg/cv834_23192.txt saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions .
