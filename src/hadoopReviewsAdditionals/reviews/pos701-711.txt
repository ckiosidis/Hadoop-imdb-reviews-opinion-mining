pos/cv698_15253.txt a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt the original tagline for patriot games was , " there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . " 
pos/cv698_15253.txt however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom " wings , " shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . 
pos/cv698_15253.txt these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . 


pos/cv555_23922.txt

pos/cv555_23922.txt harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the " silly factor " of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? 
pos/cv555_23922.txt please . . . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt if rose mcgowan is sexy then i'm marilyn manson . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he'd be the most popular guy they have . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt on a similar note , the " plot line " of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt although one does have to ask . . . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ? 
pos/cv555_23922.txt director brian robbins ( you'll remember him as eric from tv's " head of the class " ) just knows how to make good dumb movies . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt those moments made me cringe and/or groan . 
pos/cv555_23922.txt as an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll .

pos/cv124_4122.txt

pos/cv124_4122.txt there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the " quilting bee " consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt there are probably too many characters . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't " do much " for me . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . 
pos/cv124_4122.txt if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional .

pos/cv905_29114.txt hedwig ( john cameron mitchell ) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin .

pos/cv905_29114.txt she and her band , the angry inch , shadows the now-famous tommy gnosis across the us ( for revenge ? ) , but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in " hedwig and the angry inch . " 
pos/cv905_29114.txt first time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's " all that jazz " and " cabaret , " but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt  " hedwig and the angry inch " is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from " the rocky horror picture show " and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it's not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the audience i saw " hedwig " with thought so , too . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt john cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt as a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g . i . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that " mother would make me play in the oven " where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt later , as a young man , he meets luther , another g . i . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt and is swept off of his feet . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt flash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt frustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd " job " to make ends meet . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt she meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation .

pos/cv905_29114.txt hedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt things finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for " hedwig . " 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt it is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its " internationally ignored " rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt there isn't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of " rent " as a puerto rican drag queen . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt attention to details - hedwig's costumes and outrageous " cabaret " -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt  " hedwig and the angry inch " may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt if you're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw . 
pos/cv905_29114.txt i give it a b+ . 


pos/cv383_13116.txt

pos/cv383_13116.txt i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you have to reach for a larger audience . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt in any case , the answer is no . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt warning : major spoilers follow ! 
pos/cv383_13116.txt please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you have been warned . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the x-files is what a summer should be . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt so yeah , the x-files is scary . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt and guess what ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt do not think that the x-files is a monster movie . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " showers " independence day . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be " showering " godzilla instead . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who 
pos/cv383_13116.txt cares ! ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
pos/cv383_13116.txt unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! 
pos/cv383_13116.txt the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt  ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emotional scene " between godzilla attacks ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt cool effects ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt it's good some . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt pulse pounding ? 
pos/cv383_13116.txt hell yes ! 
pos/cv383_13116.txt strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many " whoah , i never saw that one coming ! " 
pos/cv383_13116.txt moments , four " holy shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an ending . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt you may wonder where this movie lost half a star . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . 
pos/cv383_13116.txt it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

pos/cv319_14727.txt the full monty is a whole lot of fun , its wacky , witty , and original . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt it's written and directed by relatively unknowns , simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo , who both turned up oscar nominations . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt how did this movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide ? 
pos/cv319_14727.txt its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year !

pos/cv319_14727.txt for instance , dave ( mark addy ) is worried about his weight , horse ( paul barber ) thinks he may be inadequate , and gerald ( tom wilkinson ) is worried about his reputation and timing .

pos/cv319_14727.txt the writing and direction are great . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt the acting is appealing , all the performances have a human quality to them , so you can relate to at least one of the characters . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt which left me wondering one thing , why didn't trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year ? 
pos/cv319_14727.txt while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy , it doesn't carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting . 
pos/cv319_14727.txt still , the full monty is a great film , a must see ! 


pos/cv740_12445.txt

pos/cv740_12445.txt a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt 'here' , of course , was still three months away . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt that , let me tell you , has changed completely . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt seriously . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry , 
pos/cv740_12445.txt make that 'roles' in the movie . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - " doesn't it just break your heart . " he mutters coldly . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt that's what really makes this movie unique . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's 
pos/cv740_12445.txt the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and 
pos/cv740_12445.txt never hit . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it 
pos/cv740_12445.txt would have wrecked her potrayal . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a 
pos/cv740_12445.txt sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - " geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? " . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt there were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt overall , this movie was not perfect . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . 
pos/cv740_12445.txt many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i 
pos/cv740_12445.txt certainly hope so . 


pos/cv138_12721.txt

pos/cv138_12721.txt the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this " assignment " , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) 
pos/cv138_12721.txt critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt i thought that was neat . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the " fake " jackal met with the " real " jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 " 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) . 
pos/cv138_12721.txt donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .

pos/cv615_14182.txt a miracle of filmmaking , " some like it hot " is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt one night , as they're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt as it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt several weeks later , on valentine's day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt the only catch . . its a girls band . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt on the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there's two problems : 1 ) they're in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt what follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the " italian opera lovers festival " . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt marilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt the scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt lemmon is hysterical as daphne . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt cast as the less rational one , lemmon's performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder's . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt brown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt he manages to use lemmon's ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt every set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt wilder's script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt wilder's is dead wrong when he says nobody's perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny . 
pos/cv615_14182.txt nobody's perfect but billy wilder . 


pos/cv126_28971.txt

pos/cv126_28971.txt i have to say it . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt ok , that's off my chest . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt no more monkey puns , i promise . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt i know , i know , i promised . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : " one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , " he says . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : " take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . " 
pos/cv126_28971.txt anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen . thade . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt the young chimp goes to visit his dying father . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : " damn them , damn them all to hell , " he says before expiring . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt the performances throughout are top-notch . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt it is a masterful turn . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt hers is a smart , compassionate characterization . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , " can't we all just get along , " echoing the words of rodney king . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt he comes close , but falls short . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . 
pos/cv126_28971.txt this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .
