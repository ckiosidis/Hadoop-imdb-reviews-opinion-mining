neg/cv235_10704.txt synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt suspense ? 
neg/cv235_10704.txt family drama ? 
neg/cv235_10704.txt humor ? 
neg/cv235_10704.txt erotica ? 
neg/cv235_10704.txt elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the father ( played by j . t . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt incredible ! 
neg/cv235_10704.txt  ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) 
neg/cv235_10704.txt if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt i can't completely trash this movie . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . 
neg/cv235_10704.txt silverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks " what were you thinking ? " 
neg/cv235_10704.txt i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . 


neg/cv587_20532.txt

neg/cv587_20532.txt when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the " inspector gadget " tv show with my older brother . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? 
neg/cv587_20532.txt right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( " oh , hi penny ! 
neg/cv587_20532.txt is brain with you ? " ) . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt the " plot " , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , 
neg/cv587_20532.txt a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt inspector gadget ! 
neg/cv587_20532.txt >from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these " treats " . 
neg/cv587_20532.txt i was just glad that it was over . 


neg/cv795_10291.txt

neg/cv795_10291.txt mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt either way look out america bean is coming . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt i think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt one thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . 
neg/cv795_10291.txt there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one . 


neg/cv759_15091.txt

neg/cv759_15091.txt vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt this has not always been carpenter's style . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? 
neg/cv759_15091.txt the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt that is not his style and it just does not work very well . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt these vampires do not maintain a low profile . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt there are arguably logical flaws in the film . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
neg/cv759_15091.txt perhaps i will read the book .

neg/cv039_5963.txt the classic story & the production which ruined it 
neg/cv039_5963.txt marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal " people . " 
neg/cv039_5963.txt douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt using shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt the island of dr . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt moreau questions the ability of men playing god . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt dr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not " prioritized " so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather 
neg/cv039_5963.txt ungloriously at times too . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt the two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to " cut a long story short " and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it's still summer , and movies have to be " marketable " ) . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt this h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt as a third outing , the island of dr . moreau 
neg/cv039_5963.txt accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes' . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
neg/cv039_5963.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
neg/cv039_5963.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff .

neg/cv839_22807.txt isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than " it sucks " ? 
neg/cv839_22807.txt one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although " boring , " " stupid " and " absurd " doesn't amount to much of a review .

neg/cv839_22807.txt here goes nothing . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt i'll keep it short . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt hill's and mgm's actions were prudent .

neg/cv839_22807.txt this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt how ? 
neg/cv839_22807.txt why ? 
neg/cv839_22807.txt the movie never bothers to explain . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt i just remember that i didn't care . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt in fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt well , the effects are good , though there's hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i'm not sure whether that's so remarkable an accomplishment . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt the performances are hardly worth talking about . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt i'm not even sure i can call what's here " performances , " though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt james spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i've seen in a while , mostly because he isn't given a character with a personality . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt the action scenes are just as bland , since they're pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly entertaining the first time around . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt and since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it's pretty much dead in the water . 
neg/cv839_22807.txt and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova .

neg/cv920_29423.txt susan granger's review of " the musketeer " ( universal pictures ) 
neg/cv920_29423.txt hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii's elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt the traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don't offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt scripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong's elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt mena suvari , so impressive in " american beauty , " seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the musketeer " is a cinematic but shallow 3 . 
neg/cv920_29423.txt  " all for one and one for all " ? 
neg/cv920_29423.txt not this time 'round .

neg/cv799_19812.txt  * * * be warned . . . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
neg/cv799_19812.txt the blair witch project . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and this worked for him . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt well , i'm sorry , but nothing . . . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
neg/cv799_19812.txt nothing is not more . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt  " nothing " is free , available all around the world at a location near you . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i could just discount them and say , " well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . " 
neg/cv799_19812.txt but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt there must be some other reason . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt  ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) 
neg/cv799_19812.txt when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout " josh ! ! " 
neg/cv799_19812.txt over and over . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and argue with each other . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting " josh ! ! " . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt  ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) 
neg/cv799_19812.txt this film is an example of marketing with no substance . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt they want this film to be good . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt this film could have been so much better . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt she was sold on this film . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked ' . . . are 
neg/cv799_19812.txt we supposed to be scared by this ? ' . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i've heard one opinion that you " have to use your imagination " to create the fear in this movie . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt use their imagination and create a good movie . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? 
neg/cv799_19812.txt an entity called the blair witch ? 
neg/cv799_19812.txt some rednecks fucking with these kids ? 
neg/cv799_19812.txt are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn't be . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt but you have to do something . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt aren't these supposed to be " filmmakers " who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that's justified . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt minor quibble there . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves " what was i thinking ? ? " . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt but , if they don't , then thats fine . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt if it works for them then that's okay i guess . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the " nothing is more " approach . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt for 90 minutes . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt and we'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , " my god , wouldn't it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! 
neg/cv799_19812.txt this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! " . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt or , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . 
neg/cv799_19812.txt  " man , do you know how scary it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! 
neg/cv799_19812.txt now this is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! "

neg/cv450_8319.txt

neg/cv450_8319.txt a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then " the vorld " ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls . 
neg/cv450_8319.txt since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? 
neg/cv450_8319.txt only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie .
