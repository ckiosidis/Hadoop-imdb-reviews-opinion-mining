neg/cv899_17812.txt in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt fortunately , for audience members there's a chance to escape the nearest exit . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy's worst movie and that's an accomplishment . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt remember the golden child , harlem nights ? 
neg/cv899_17812.txt compared to life , they look like citizen kane . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt life is long , predictable , foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt robert ramsey and matthew stone's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as " motherf . . . s " or " n . . . . . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt s . " 
neg/cv899_17812.txt you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt but , like life , it will probably stink . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt life is as sophisticated as a belch . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt it's crude and stereotypical . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second-class people , good for being only maids and servants . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast-talking , conniving , scam artists or hip-hop , gun-crazy , sex-crazed youths . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt both sets of caricatures are demeaning . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt and the fault does not rest with the actors . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt they have to eat , too . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green-light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt life's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt otherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it . 
neg/cv899_17812.txt see it at your own risk .

neg/cv053_23117.txt one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i'm wondering the same thing . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i just didn't . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt no , but i expected something . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt a funny joke . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt a clever prank . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt a plot development . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt anything . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt the movie never delivers . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt  " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt that's it . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they have a garage band . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they have tickets , they lose them . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they get more tickets , they lose those too . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt there's not much more to it . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt  " detroit rock city " doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt and what about that script ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt funny ! " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt see ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt funny ! 
neg/cv053_23117.txt look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt twice . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt see ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt funny ! 
neg/cv053_23117.txt look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt see ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt funny ! 
neg/cv053_23117.txt a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt that's it , i've said enough about this movie . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it's a waste of time and money . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt you want to see this concept executed well ? 
neg/cv053_23117.txt go rent roger corman's 1979 classic " rock n' roll high school . " 
neg/cv053_23117.txt it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . 
neg/cv053_23117.txt yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

neg/cv640_5380.txt  " you damn dirty apes ! " 
neg/cv640_5380.txt that's just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that's taken on a comedic context over time . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston's acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this " mystery science theater 3000 " wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes . . . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt the list goes on . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt the thing is , on this planet humans can't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt heston's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt he surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt believe me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god " created ape in his image . " 
neg/cv640_5380.txt but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , " if humans couldn't speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! " 
neg/cv640_5380.txt and how do you account for your acting ability , mr . heston ? 
neg/cv640_5380.txt the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie's surprise conclusion . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt i won't reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling " god damn you all to hell ! " 
neg/cv640_5380.txt several times in succession . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt but let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ? 
neg/cv640_5380.txt ape : but . . . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt you're so . . . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt ugly . ) , he'd convert to creationism on the spot . 
neg/cv640_5380.txt luckily for us , science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good . 


neg/cv451_11502.txt

neg/cv451_11502.txt call " hush " " stop or my mom will kill . " 
neg/cv451_11502.txt or " mommy fearest . " 
neg/cv451_11502.txt or " the hand that robs the cradle . " 
neg/cv451_11502.txt call it whatever you want , but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- " hush " scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given " hush " a send-off that's downright infuriating . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt it's too bad that " hush " is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she's concerned . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt if there's one reason to catch " hush , " it's lange . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt when she delves into martha's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt but can you really blame them ? 
neg/cv451_11502.txt the character relationships in " hush " hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( " why did you yell ? " 
neg/cv451_11502.txt helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? 
neg/cv451_11502.txt does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? 
neg/cv451_11502.txt if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , " hush " would be a really short movie . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt and then there's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt i won't spoil what happens next except to say that it's contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i'm no doctor ) medically impossible . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt it's just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt no one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . 
neg/cv451_11502.txt perhaps " hush " 's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

neg/cv657_25835.txt wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt murder at 1600 , u . s . marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt ultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt oddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes " masterpiece , " rising sun . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary-hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo's hong kong films combined . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt i usually enjoy snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt simply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt it also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script , watch the dailies , be involved in casting , or anything else -- or else he'd be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt it's also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt i'm sure over the next couple of months , even more " chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks " are going to be popping up in your local multiplex . 
neg/cv657_25835.txt hopefully they won't include wesley snipes . 


neg/cv322_21820.txt

neg/cv322_21820.txt in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don't cut it . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt for those who remember disney's fantastic " adventures of ichabod crane " , it is actually superior to this . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt disney's version was at least interesting , while burton's film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt no one could stop him , not even ichabod . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt another pathetic element of the film was the script . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt he completely butchered the story to pieces . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt the acting by depp was quite notable . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt if it wasn't for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt it's too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt the atmosphere too was quite involving . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt at least burton's films are eye candy , even if they are trash . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt other than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . 
neg/cv322_21820.txt this is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this .

neg/cv195_16146.txt one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt guess who wins ? 
neg/cv195_16146.txt nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening " whipped cream bikini . " 
neg/cv195_16146.txt it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . 
neg/cv195_16146.txt there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .

neg/cv182_7791.txt nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt cage should have known what he was getting himself into . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt there's a word for people like you , nicolas . 
neg/cv182_7791.txt that word is called recidivist . . . repeat 
neg/cv182_7791.txt offender . 


neg/cv981_16679.txt

neg/cv981_16679.txt director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama " when a man loves a woman , " but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , " message in a bottle , " which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , " meaningful " statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt  " message in a bottle " begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt do you think you know where this is headed ? 
neg/cv981_16679.txt most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt if there are any positive things to say about " message in a bottle , " it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , " shaggy dog " love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the " friend " roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt the first half of " message in a bottle " plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time " getting to know " garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt " written , " and not as if people were really " talking . " 
neg/cv981_16679.txt when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt i swear that while watching " message in a bottle , " i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , " city of angels . " 
neg/cv981_16679.txt although theresa is deeply touched by the " heartfelt " letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . 
neg/cv981_16679.txt it should have read , " memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! " 


neg/cv828_21392.txt

neg/cv828_21392.txt that is , unless you're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt however , if they * hadn't * given it away , the film would've still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt obviously , the producers thought they could remake " the deep end of the ocean , " throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt  " double jeopardy " offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he didn't see to be on screen half as much as judd did . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt it also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full-of-tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt half the time i'm wondering whether i'm watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt the movie's stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt implausible material , no less . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , " that is * not * possible * . " 
neg/cv828_21392.txt that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like " double jeopardy " that tries to pass itself off as serious drama . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt everything seems dragged out , overplayed . 
neg/cv828_21392.txt when they should've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early .
