pos/cv662_13320.txt hollywood has a . 750 
pos/cv662_13320.txt batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . 
pos/cv662_13320.txt here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch .

pos/cv353_18159.txt

pos/cv353_18159.txt with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt >from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like " sliding doors on steroids . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt while you are watching , this will not matter . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . 
pos/cv353_18159.txt it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .

pos/cv872_12591.txt

pos/cv872_12591.txt robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in " the natural " ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be " the best there ever was , " but still acted like a humble farm boy . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in " butch cassidy and the sundance kid " ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt even in " indecent proposal " ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in his latest film , " the horse whisperer , " based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase " horse whisperer " to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in " the horse whisperer , " country is clearly the victor . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed " a river runs through it " six years ago . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in many ways , " the horse whisperer " comes from the same poetic vein as " river , " and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt but then , that would ruin the magic . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( " natural born killers , " " platoon " ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in terms of the story itself , " the horse whisperer " gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's " a brief encounter " ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's " the bridges of madison county " ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted " bridges " ) . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt although " the horse whisperer " has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt in " the horse whisperer , " the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt the best scenes in " the horse whisperer " tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . 
pos/cv872_12591.txt although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make " the horse whisperer " worth the price of admission . 


pos/cv540_3421.txt

pos/cv540_3421.txt i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- " memories of underdevelopment " . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt the proper questions to put relate to castro's legitimacy . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i bet the film takes castro's power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba's state control , cannot question his right to run cuba's political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i saw the film--twice . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt i was right ; castro remained intact . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young " dialectic materialist , " as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution's reason for being . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt cuba's government is castro . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt diego's lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt he enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt he does not do " voluntary work " for the revolution . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt his small apartment is a sensual oasis . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt the moniker " bourgeois " figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt however , he is a " revolucionario " in his own way . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt the supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david's roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david's ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt gutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt he really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt real criticism is missing though . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt this movie is political window dressing . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt luis aguilar leon's op . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt ed . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt piece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film's political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . 
pos/cv540_3421.txt as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept " the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . " 
pos/cv540_3421.txt although terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . 


pos/cv730_10279.txt

pos/cv730_10279.txt the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and " real " movies . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt in the press notes the book's author describes the story as " a parable of lost children . " 
pos/cv730_10279.txt he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of " the pied piper " from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the story unfolds slowly and always believably . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt each little aspect has its own fascination . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt  ( " i can help you , " mitchell tries to reassure billy . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt  " not unless you can raise the dead , " billy snaps back . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) 
pos/cv730_10279.txt mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt more than anything , the film is like a master painting . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . 
pos/cv730_10279.txt it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers .

pos/cv632_9610.txt its last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt it's nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren't too derivative of the titular menace from " alien . " 
pos/cv632_9610.txt these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that's all sharp talons and even sharper legs . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt they attack in packs of hundreds , and it's a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt the occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member's death , the final resolution to johnny's love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how " starship troopers " fails to create any strong , outstanding characters . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt these bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm's length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la " star wars , " where even the slightest aliens had definite personality . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt the acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on " beverly hills 90210 " and/or " melrose place " -- and it occasionally shows . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt van dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt in smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny's best friend and jake busey ( gary's son ) as johnny's sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see " the frighteners " or " contact " ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt  " starship troopers " is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn't exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994's howler " the puppet masters . " 
pos/cv632_9610.txt but the overall familiarity to the " alien " trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt its own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation " alien : resurrection " opens in a few weeks . 
pos/cv632_9610.txt we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . 


pos/cv463_10343.txt

pos/cv463_10343.txt one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt in scene after scene the picture charms the audience . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt who wouldn't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt and , of course , he doesn't just win , he does so by splitting the other man's arrow . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt the adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt jeffrey thinks the film is " great " and gives it * * * * . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies . 
pos/cv463_10343.txt his favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) . 


pos/cv504_29243.txt

pos/cv504_29243.txt i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating " comedy " of chris tucker . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt this time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? ) . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt of course , it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt he refuses to shut up . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head , but his jokes just aren't funny , a pathetic mixture of sub-par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn't anyone realize how irritating tucker's incessant ranting and raving was ? 
pos/cv504_29243.txt if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt fortunately , chan makes for a marvelous straight man , and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt it's not often that one actor can so completely save a movie , but there is no other name for what he does ; whenever he's on screen , rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking , often hilarious , life . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a " player , " but who cares ? 
pos/cv504_29243.txt i can think of few high concepts that are funnier . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt the movie ends with outtakes that , as usual , show that chan isn't perfect , and that it does , indeed , take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt chris tucker botches some lines as well , and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt it's not great jackie chan , but it's jackie chan , and that's enough . 
pos/cv504_29243.txt up next : jay and silent bob strike back 


pos/cv109_21172.txt

pos/cv109_21172.txt not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy " tourist " named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are " don't talk about fight club . " 
pos/cv109_21172.txt armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . 
pos/cv109_21172.txt hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us . 


pos/cv511_10132.txt

pos/cv511_10132.txt i'm an avid fan of the " alien " saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because " alien : resurrection , " the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt in short , i had a good time . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt  " alien : resurrection " leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called " the auriga " by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt oh well . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old " alien " -brand fun . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in " aliens " with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt  " alien " is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt  " aliens " is a wild , tense thriller . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt  " alien 3 " is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt  " alien 4 " is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like " das boot " has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since " face/off " towards the beginning ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt one is the aforementioned surgery scene . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , " delicatessen " ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to " goldfinger " ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an " 8 " tatooed on her arm ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : " who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! " 
pos/cv511_10132.txt johner : " well , i can get you off . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt but not this ship . " ) 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in " se7en " who performed the " lust " sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for " aliens , " but she's just awesome . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . 
pos/cv511_10132.txt but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the " alien " series .
