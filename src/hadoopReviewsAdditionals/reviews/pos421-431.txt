pos/cv290_11084.txt slavery is bad . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest " serious " film . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt fifty-three of them are stuffed into the " la amistad " ( from a spanish word for " friendship " ) by their new spanish owners . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt if they are property , who do they belong to ? 
pos/cv290_11084.txt their masters ? 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the spanish government ? 
pos/cv290_11084.txt salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the us government ? 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the defendants are pawns in several games . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt much like his " shindler's list " ( which followed " jurassic park " as this follows " lost world " ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt it's not hard to see who the bad guys are . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt he has to make the story interesting . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt spielberg succeeds for the most part . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt there are very few _people_ in the tale . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt tappan and joadson are " abolitionists " : symbols but not humans . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt van buren is a weak politician but nothing else . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the rest of the " slaves " barely exist other than dressing for the set . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the former model's first major role is a winner . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in " nixon " ) . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt there are some other great moments . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . 
pos/cv290_11084.txt more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

pos/cv516_11172.txt luckily , some people got starship troopers . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt some people knew it was supposed to be silly . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 
pos/cv516_11172.txt from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt meet the equivalent of " beverly hills 90210 " meets " mighty morphin power rangers " . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of " seventeen " magazine . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt  ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt not since the old " mr . bill " skits on " saturday night live " has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt this is brainless heaven . 
pos/cv516_11172.txt just remember not to think . 


pos/cv242_10638.txt

pos/cv242_10638.txt ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars 
pos/cv242_10638.txt synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt he replies something like : " the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . " 
pos/cv242_10638.txt in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? 
pos/cv242_10638.txt opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun . 
pos/cv242_10638.txt relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn . 


pos/cv569_26381.txt

pos/cv569_26381.txt after a rather disappointing " mary railly " , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt in fact it's not even a comedy . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt rob gordon was a dj . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt he starts " categorizing " life , dividing it into " top 5 lists " . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt and the most important is the " top 5 list " over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt where did he go wrong ? 
pos/cv569_26381.txt was it he that screwed up ? 
pos/cv569_26381.txt or maybe life just stinks ? 
pos/cv569_26381.txt while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the " top 5 list " over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt he is simply superb . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it is as much his movie as it is frears' . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt the film would not be the same without him . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt both ______ and jack black are fabulous . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt he is simply a joy to behold . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt pretty much like edward norton's " keeping the faith " , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt nothing seems unreal or staged . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it reflects reality as a mirror . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt you feel and think and reflect . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt this effect has become a rarity nowadays . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt and so does the movie . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt in the end , you have gained something while watching it . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it's not the film of the century or even of the year . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it's not an special effects extravaganza . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt it's a small movie about the big things . 
pos/cv569_26381.txt and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . 


pos/cv445_25882.txt

pos/cv445_25882.txt what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt what can we do ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt it is the land of opportunities . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt it is the land of freedom . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt but what if it became the new target ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . " 
pos/cv445_25882.txt then all hell breaks loose in new york . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt a broadway theater is bombed . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt hostages are taken at a school . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! 
pos/cv445_25882.txt f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt but the attacks escalate . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the land is under siege . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt they have lost control . . a 
pos/cv445_25882.txt terror is coming from within . . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt it reflects reality . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt and that's why it makes such an impact . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . " 
pos/cv445_25882.txt in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt was that what the terror ! 
pos/cv445_25882.txt ists really wanted ? 
pos/cv445_25882.txt this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt but to me these protests seem unnecessary . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the script is therefore wonderfully balanced . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . " 
pos/cv445_25882.txt but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! 
pos/cv445_25882.txt way . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt denzel washington is dashing as always . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the film is elegantly shaped . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt he tightens the intensity as the events progress . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . 
pos/cv445_25882.txt it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .

pos/cv773_18817.txt when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? 
pos/cv773_18817.txt -- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt ironically , powers' " yeeeeah baby , yeah ! " 
pos/cv773_18817.txt has almost become an icon of the late 90s . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like " do you smoke after sex ? " 
pos/cv773_18817.txt  " i don't know , baby , i never looked . " 
pos/cv773_18817.txt this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious " just the two of us " rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named " mini-me " . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did . 
pos/cv773_18817.txt but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough .

pos/cv839_21467.txt assume nothing . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the point ? 
pos/cv839_21467.txt to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt well , another popular phrase of the 90's is " all good things must come to an end , " and this stays true for oscar as well . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt why is this ? 
pos/cv839_21467.txt he thinks oscar is gay . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt he's not afraid to share this with him either . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt oscar stands in shock after the words , " i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , " are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the word spreads instantly through town . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt will oscar " come out " of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? 
pos/cv839_21467.txt one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt comedy " friends , " as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt stick to the t . v . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt drama , the practice , dylan . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt no originality or technique is used whatsoever . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt three to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt unlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt  ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) 
pos/cv839_21467.txt three to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt three to tango is a gem . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . 
pos/cv839_21467.txt one of the better romantic comedies of 1999 . 


pos/cv096_11474.txt

pos/cv096_11474.txt everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with " progress . " 
pos/cv096_11474.txt giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three-dimensional human being . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt  ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) 
pos/cv096_11474.txt eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a " fish out of water " tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . 
pos/cv096_11474.txt it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . 


pos/cv503_10558.txt

pos/cv503_10558.txt there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt  " good will hunting " is about one of those people . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and he works at mit . . . as the janitor . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( " breaking the waves " 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and , duh , it's done again . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , " afternoon delight " ) . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 
pos/cv503_10558.txt should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 
pos/cv503_10558.txt this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt i'm not saying " good will hunting " is a bad film at all . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt there are tons of individual moments that i adored . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt their relationship never goes beyond " just best friends , " and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt maybe it was just me . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of " to die for , " the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this " best picture " deal ? ) . 
pos/cv503_10558.txt and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .

pos/cv065_15248.txt what a great film .

pos/cv065_15248.txt >from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way .

pos/cv065_15248.txt shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported .

pos/cv065_15248.txt other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt benigni+s guido realizes this . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt he is the clown , but he is not a fool . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt perhaps that is a form of denial . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt or . . . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt surprisingly , it works . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt i believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt however , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt it swept the italian academy awards . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt controversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt masterful . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt miraculous . 
pos/cv065_15248.txt a must-see .
