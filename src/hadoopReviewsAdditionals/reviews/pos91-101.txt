pos/cv850_16466.txt buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the truth is he isn't married . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt ricci's performance during the scene at gallo's parent's home are very well done . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo's character is developed very well . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt this character seemed very realistic to me . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt ricci's character is funny and different . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ! 
pos/cv850_16466.txt ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt buffalo ? 66 isn't all laughs though . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt many scenes are very dramatic and depressing . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt gallo's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt overall , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some people put it up to be . 
pos/cv850_16466.txt the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .

pos/cv842_5866.txt if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt once they get to mexico , it's time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt that's right , we've come all this way to see a vampire movie . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt but like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes " a lap dog of satan . " 
pos/cv842_5866.txt the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment . 
pos/cv842_5866.txt from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie . 


pos/cv141_15686.txt

pos/cv141_15686.txt  " very bad things , " is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt as robert puts it : " there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . " 
pos/cv141_15686.txt after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt  " okay , there is only one option now . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt you can forget about calling the police , " he says . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt  " very bad things , " which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , " there's something about mary , " wanted to be . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt there's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , " stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , " i couldn't help but crack up at how " balls-to-the-wall " this film had become . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt it is at this level that , " very bad things , " was so entertaining and surprising . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt although i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : " very bad things , " is not a movie for everyone . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt luckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . 
pos/cv141_15686.txt the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and " safe " wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . 


pos/cv202_10654.txt

pos/cv202_10654.txt steven spielberg's " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt  " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt  " what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt  " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . 
pos/cv202_10654.txt however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . 


pos/cv694_4876.txt

pos/cv694_4876.txt alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt kieslowski's blue , that is . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt alchemy is divided into three chapters : " charity " , " faith " , and " hope " . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a " back-to- nature " cult . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? 
pos/cv694_4876.txt are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? 
pos/cv694_4876.txt myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt through louisa's struggles , she succeeds . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt the cinematography is stunning . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt later , when louisa reaches the " wilderness " , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use " alchemy " to provide for the needs of the body and soul . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . 
pos/cv694_4876.txt alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close .

pos/cv533_9821.txt capsule : trippy , hyperspeed action machine from hong kong's accomplished tsui hark . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt van damme and rodman have nice chemistry , the stunts are eyepopping , and stuff gets blowed up real good ; what more do you want ? 
pos/cv533_9821.txt i admit i was all set to loathe double team ; it reeked of cheapjack timing-oriented marketing ( stick dennis rodman in a movie , quick , while he's hot , and do something about jean-claude van damme's flagging career while we're at it ! ) . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt surprise -- double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt bring some friends , get some pretzels , and have a blast . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt van damme is jack quinn , an ex-agent who is brought back in for " one last mission " -- you'd think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt but van damme's character has a pregnant wife who's also a sculptor , and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt he's been assigned to take down an old enemy , a terrorist named stavros ( mickey rourke , looking oddly subdued ) , who may be back up to his old tricks . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt in the first showdown between quinn and stavros , the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve : nonstop action . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt an amusement park , a hospital , a private " retired spy " 's retreat , most of rome , various houses , planes , cars and other modes of transport , and the coliseum ( ! ) 
pos/cv533_9821.txt all become arenas for some of the most bone-rattling shoot-outs and punch-outs filmed . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film : one jaw-dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his * feet * . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt  ( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . ) 
pos/cv533_9821.txt there are other nice touches . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt stavros and quinn both want the same thing : to retire in peace with their families . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt that ambition ties them together in various ways , and also humanizes them a bit . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt one of the things about hk action movies is that there's always some form of human element , and that's carried over into this movie as well . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there . 
pos/cv533_9821.txt rodman is natural on screen ; he's fun to watch , especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs , and deserves to get a movie of his own , based on what's seen here : a lightweight , fast-moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently . 


pos/cv192_14395.txt

pos/cv192_14395.txt in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' 
pos/cv192_14395.txt along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . 
pos/cv192_14395.txt in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .

pos/cv985_6359.txt this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt  " shine " has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty " life " ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and " love and other catastrophes " ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt  " shine " was one bookend . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt stand by for the other one : " dead heart " . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt >from the opening credits the theme of division is established . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt bryan | brown . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the local police officer has the task of enforcing " white man's justice " to the aboriginals . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is " payback " . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt an eye for an eye . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt revenge . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal " payback " . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt  ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the " white fellas " church - has a foot on either side of the line . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he is part churchman and part politician . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt she appears to not know this . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt everyone is affected in the fall out . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt suffice to say it's a rewarding experience . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt his officer is real , human and therefore flawed . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : " jedda " , " the chant of jimmie blacksmith " and " the last wave " . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as " dead heart " . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt the aboriginal priest best sums this up . 
pos/cv985_6359.txt he is asked to say if he is a " black fella or white fella " .

pos/cv007_4968.txt one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , " money versus values . " 
pos/cv007_4968.txt ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . 
pos/cv007_4968.txt and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

pos/cv434_5793.txt the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  " unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt unlike fires , there is no way to combat them . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt unlike floods , their terror is sudden . " 
pos/cv434_5793.txt - excerpt from twister production notes 
pos/cv434_5793.txt i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that 
pos/cv434_5793.txt is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt watch it in a good theatre . . . please . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt  * * * * * perfection . 
pos/cv434_5793.txt see it twice .
