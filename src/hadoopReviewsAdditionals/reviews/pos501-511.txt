pos/cv170_3006.txt i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt in my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt if you were expecting airplane ! -like 
pos/cv170_3006.txt laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt honest , it is . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt this story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt penny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt unfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt while trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt along with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt law ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt the special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie . 
pos/cv170_3006.txt overall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use .

pos/cv162_10424.txt

pos/cv162_10424.txt note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt be forewarned . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt it's hard to understate this last point . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional " a film by wes craven " drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads " written by kevin williamson " , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt  ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of " a film by " is attained . ) 
pos/cv162_10424.txt and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the " true life " events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 
pos/cv162_10424.txt there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt  ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) 
pos/cv162_10424.txt indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . 
pos/cv162_10424.txt  ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) 
pos/cv162_10424.txt but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : " no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! " 
pos/cv162_10424.txt look what that got her . 


pos/cv013_10159.txt

pos/cv013_10159.txt synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . 
pos/cv013_10159.txt djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . 


pos/cv087_1989.txt

pos/cv087_1989.txt many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt stephane attempts to remain unchanged . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i am not sure why berardinelli says , " at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . " 
pos/cv087_1989.txt this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt this portion of the film is where the " sense of closure " could have been successfully accomplished . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the directing in this movie is wonderful . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . 
pos/cv087_1989.txt i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .

pos/cv405_20399.txt plot : good ol' texan kid suddenly gets to play first-string quarterback on his high school team's football team , in a town where football is considered religion .

pos/cv405_20399.txt the good ol' texan boy does not approve of said man's methods . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt critique : a fun football movie . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt this film was obviously geared towards the teen market , with mtv behind its production , a big tv star actor in the lead role , rockin' hip music galore , and plenty of t&a . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt having said that , i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie , thought james van der beek gave a solid performance , loved the slick sounds , and yup , loved that t&a ! 
pos/cv405_20399.txt i actually thought this was a comedy going in , but overall , it plays more towards the dramatic , than a comedy . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt i also enjoyed jon voight's performance as the stubborn dick coach , as well as many of the other character players on the team . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination , but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the " fun " game of football , or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and forty-five minutes in the movie theatre ( or in the comfort of their own home , depending on where you watch this stuff . ) 
pos/cv405_20399.txt all in all , i would definitely watch this movie if you like football , play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff . 
pos/cv405_20399.txt and did i mention the t&a ? 
pos/cv405_20399.txt  : )

pos/cv405_20399.txt that's right , he's sonny's son ! 
pos/cv405_20399.txt actress amy smart , who plays van der beek's girlfriend in this movie , also played the main star's girl in the 1999 film outside providence ( 6 . 5/10 ) .

pos/cv421_9709.txt ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
pos/cv421_9709.txt it's title : starship troopers . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the 'star wars' of the 90s . " 
pos/cv421_9709.txt am i being to generous to this film ? 
pos/cv421_9709.txt perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens'-asses " style . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt and they should be . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt stating , " would you like to know more ? " , 
pos/cv421_9709.txt these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt and as a result , dizzy signs up . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt an hour into the film , the war begins . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt it's about special effects and gory violence . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt to most guys , he will come across as artificial . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt her dizzy is extremely likeable . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , he does give a good performance . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt his performance rises above the rest . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt director verhoeven is the main star of the film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt his direction is fast and unrelentless . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the dialogue is smart but not too smart . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt oh , and the special effects are first rate . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt it is extremely violent . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . 
pos/cv421_9709.txt now that would be entertaining ! 


pos/cv828_19831.txt

pos/cv828_19831.txt all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt i must question the studio that releases a movie like this . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt i loved the young cast in this movie . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt but i never used baked goods . ' 
pos/cv828_19831.txt it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt there are some less-than-original aspects of the film . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' 
pos/cv828_19831.txt and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . 
pos/cv828_19831.txt in it's own way . 


pos/cv321_12843.txt

pos/cv321_12843.txt it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt and so it is . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt _the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i've seen since i-don't-know-when . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt don't credit carrey . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt the story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt  ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that " reality-based " television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt who knew ? ) 
pos/cv321_12843.txt one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn " on " and act goofy whenever the camera is near . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt not here . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt no pun intended . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 " work the problem , people " character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt he thinks . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt dalloway ) as carrey's true " forbidden love " , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt there are other little problems with the script . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? 
pos/cv321_12843.txt was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? 
pos/cv321_12843.txt how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? 
pos/cv321_12843.txt and couldn't christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? 
pos/cv321_12843.txt these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman's mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . 
pos/cv321_12843.txt just checking . 


pos/cv851_20469.txt

pos/cv851_20469.txt after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt the review 
pos/cv851_20469.txt two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom's house or just down the street . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most " wife who can no longer handle her husband " parts . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls " a private club that i'm not invited to " , where they whisper about things all day long . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film . 
pos/cv851_20469.txt if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year's best . 


pos/cv053_21822.txt

pos/cv053_21822.txt earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt shanta has a small circle of male admirers . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt  ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) 
pos/cv053_21822.txt in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt another man is murdered . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the group of friends will not meet again . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt the story earth tells does not end . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt it just stops . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . 
pos/cv053_21822.txt earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie .
