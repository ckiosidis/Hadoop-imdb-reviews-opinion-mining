pos/cv793_13650.txt as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt as the flap falls , the battle begins . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler's list . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt a soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body-strewn beach like a lost puppy . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt he bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; " what now ? " 
pos/cv793_13650.txt saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the question is , " does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? " 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the answer from my point of view is " no " . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt ryan is ten times worse . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt many in the theater could not bear to watch . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film's primary mission . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don't yet know him . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt spielberg , though not a student of the " quick cut " school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt bay should pay close attention , take copious notes . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the " importance " of the film . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt schindler's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt it opened eyes , sparked debate and study . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , " war is hell . " 
pos/cv793_13650.txt but braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again . 
pos/cv793_13650.txt masterful work marred only by excessive gore . 


pos/cv437_22849.txt

pos/cv437_22849.txt david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt the story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt the world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are " hiding " in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt as they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt she flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt to inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt the events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist , as the " players " are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise , which is structured as a computer game , with " tasks " that the characters must complete to win the game . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt released after " the matrix " and " dark city " , " existenz " has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt however , " existenz " is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt a combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made " the matrix " a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt  " existenz " has a completely different atmosphere , resembling " dark city " , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt  " existenz " has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt after the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt while i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt and indeed , " existenz " seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt and jet the film fails on several issues . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt probably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg's script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it's a cold , dark place where the " players " are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt david cronenberg has been the creator of " the fly " , " videodrome " and " the dead zone " , so it's not so hard to guess that " existenz " is a violent and gory film . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt besides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt the way i see it , this is the film's crucial failure . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt because of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt during the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt  " the matrix " , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt  " existenz " does not . 
pos/cv437_22849.txt it is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . 


pos/cv645_15668.txt

pos/cv645_15668.txt some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called " sexual revolution " , same as all other " revolutions " of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt instead of being " liberated " , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt the difference between the two is simply in the line of work . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising . 
pos/cv645_15668.txt anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . 


pos/cv214_12294.txt

pos/cv214_12294.txt capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt alas , the times are a-changin' . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt the big hit is quite the opposite . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride . 
pos/cv214_12294.txt definately one of the better ways to spend two hours . 


pos/cv752_24155.txt

pos/cv752_24155.txt you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt not in the least . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt `keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt `keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt aww , what the hell . 
pos/cv752_24155.txt the quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . 


pos/cv616_29319.txt

pos/cv616_29319.txt a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? 
pos/cv616_29319.txt - and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt and that is how it should be . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt the script follows the familiar lines of the classic . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt the performances in o vary . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt it is irrational . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt but these are minor carpings . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . 
pos/cv616_29319.txt if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . 


pos/cv778_17330.txt

pos/cv778_17330.txt i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt i still think that " the bridge on the river kwai " doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt and i think that " 12 angry men " , " witness for the prosecution " and " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt the film is set in burma in 1943 . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt  ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) 
pos/cv778_17330.txt that means , the picture isn't perfect . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt but it has a lot of virtues as well . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt  " the bridge on the river kwai " shows the " madness " of war and what it can produce in people's minds . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt the other actors deliver fine performances as well . 
pos/cv778_17330.txt i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

pos/cv358_10691.txt

pos/cv358_10691.txt contrary to the title , " the boxer " is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt oh well . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt it's still an excellent irish story . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt  " the boxer " of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's " shallow grave " ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( " breaking the waves " 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like " raging bull " /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt but the backbone of the story is the love one . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt though " the boxer " is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . 
pos/cv358_10691.txt even if it could have been better , this'll do .

pos/cv706_24716.txt what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt since the release of 'rumble in the bronx " back in 1996 ( the u . s . release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt his latest release , " shanghai noon " , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( " the western gets a kick in the pants " ) rings true . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt on a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson ) . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt chon demands to know where carson city is . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt roy directs him , and chon leaves . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt  " shanghai noon " is just good fun . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the chemistry between the cast is remarkable . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of " the haunting " , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt his innocence is refreshing and fun . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt a bad guy that's not really bad . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt nothing here is realistic , mind you . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt  " shanghai noon " is first and foremost a light , jovial film . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt and the performances match that style with ease . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt using calgary , alberta as the prime location . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt homage to such films as " high noon " ( obviously ) , " red river " and most notably " butch cassidy & the sundance kid " all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt it is a comforting experience . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt this is the purest " horse opera " since the days of george o'brian or john wayne . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt nothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt and what of the action and stunts . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt well , while not up to a level of " drunken master 2 " or any of jackie's hong kong films , " shanghai noon " is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt to sum up , " shanghai noon " is a fun summer confection . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt not too heavy and not too light . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . 
pos/cv706_24716.txt an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .

pos/cv725_10103.txt the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt but we haven't . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since " while you where sleeping " .

pos/cv725_10103.txt meg ryan , known from " when harry met sally " or " sleepless in seattle " , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years " courage under fire " where she played a gulf war pilot . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them .

pos/cv725_10103.txt after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? 
pos/cv725_10103.txt his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt she would do anything to harm anton . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt he is , well , repulsive . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt that's all there is to say about him . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps .

pos/cv725_10103.txt worlds collide , i . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt e . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt the usa and france . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt this can only go wrong .

pos/cv725_10103.txt not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt sam certainly isn't . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt too bad for anton . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt for him things take a turn to the worse . 
pos/cv725_10103.txt  " addicted to love " is one of this year's most pleasant surprises .
