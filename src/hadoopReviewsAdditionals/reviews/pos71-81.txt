pos/cv926_17059.txt billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt jacob and lou want to pocket the cash . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt disaster is sure to strike . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . 
pos/cv926_17059.txt fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .

pos/cv442_13846.txt seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
pos/cv442_13846.txt war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt  " saving private ryan " is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt  " poor " is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is " right " and good and that the nazis are " inherently evil . " 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , " like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . " 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt sure , there's a zinger here and there , but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? 
pos/cv442_13846.txt that's not a premise for thrills , it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . 
pos/cv442_13846.txt i remember reading a " calvin & hobbes " comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , " dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? " 
pos/cv442_13846.txt  " saving private ryan " is the adult version of that question .

pos/cv831_14689.txt razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt official release : halloween 
pos/cv831_14689.txt reviewed by vince yim 
pos/cv831_14689.txt `you think you know all about vampires . . . believe 
pos/cv831_14689.txt me . . . you 
pos/cv831_14689.txt know f * ck all . ' 
pos/cv831_14689.txt with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? 
pos/cv831_14689.txt with that out of the way , let me say this . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt this film is bad . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt this film is really , really bad . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt period . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt that is , unless that is intentional . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt you can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt you'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt you'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . 
pos/cv831_14689.txt while this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .

pos/cv484_25054.txt susan granger's review of " the perfect storm " ( warner bros . ) 
pos/cv484_25054.txt  " more people die on fishing boats , per capita , than working in any other job in the u . s . . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all-or-nothing risk . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying , " says director wolfgang petersen ( " das boot " ) . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt and that's just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat , the andrea gail , sailing out of gloucester , massachusetts , in late october , 1991 . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt early in bill wittliff's screenplay , based on sebastian junger's best-seller , we meet the crew of six . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can't find fish on the grand banks , yet a rival skipper ( mary elizabeth mastrantonio ) brings in huge hauls . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt his right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) needs money to build a new life with his girl-friend ( diane lane ) . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt there's a devoted dad ( john c . reilly ) with an estranged wife and son , a free-spirited jamaican ( allen payne ) , a lonely guy ( john hawkes ) , and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) .

pos/cv484_25054.txt of fish that could spoil . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt but that's minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt it's formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome . 
pos/cv484_25054.txt on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the perfect storm " is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 .

pos/cv664_4389.txt

pos/cv664_4389.txt if you've ever perused my college comedy diary " another year in the life of a nerd " ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt scratch that idea . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt of course , in my case it would be a silent picture . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt i'm glad i did . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you " columbo " fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( " communists ! " ) . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt so , in his grandson's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed . . . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt or am i confusing movie plots again ? 
pos/cv664_4389.txt roommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt death , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt the number can't be counted on one hand , unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran ) . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt i won't come out and say it . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt instead , i'll just sit here and hum " eye of the tiger " until each and every one of you figures it out . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt roommates plays on all the major emotions . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt my point ? 
pos/cv664_4389.txt there are no absolutes . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt or , another possible point , peter falk just isn't such a great box office draw . 
pos/cv664_4389.txt either way , this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did , whether you hate your roommate or not . 


pos/cv072_6169.txt

pos/cv072_6169.txt the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt while ice skating ? 
pos/cv072_6169.txt jackson and davis make a good team . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the " toughness " a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . 
pos/cv072_6169.txt anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .

pos/cv711_11665.txt in " the sweet hereafter , " writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt however , according to stephens , there are no " accidents " in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt  " i don't know who i'm taking to , " he tells her . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt in his mind , his daughter is dead . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt however , not everyone in town wants it to happen . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt central to " the sweet hereafter " is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into " a wheelchair girl , " as she puts it . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt of all the storylines in " the sweet hereafter , " this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt what egoyan has done in " the sweet hereafter " is really nothing short of miraculous . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt  " the sweet hereafter " is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt  " the sweet hereafter " seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . 
pos/cv711_11665.txt certainly one of the best films of 1997 , " the sweet hereafter " is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . 


pos/cv810_12458.txt

pos/cv810_12458.txt when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against " scum " is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he " knows stuff " . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt matthew " sport " ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt porno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly " liberated " betsy . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless " messages " that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . 
pos/cv810_12458.txt now , more than two decades later , when some other " life imitating art " incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . 


pos/cv816_13655.txt

pos/cv816_13655.txt in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter isn't everything . " 
pos/cv816_13655.txt i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt see , spoofs are easy with me . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter ) . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt mafia ! 
pos/cv816_13655.txt has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt to describe the story of mafia ! 
pos/cv816_13655.txt is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! 
pos/cv816_13655.txt to his experience . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt he looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt he's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! 
pos/cv816_13655.txt that i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt but that's a good sign : mafia ! 
pos/cv816_13655.txt is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . 
pos/cv816_13655.txt finally , a film that does this for me . 


pos/cv444_9974.txt

pos/cv444_9974.txt a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt men in black is a four-star three-star film . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt  ( hope you could follow that one ) 
pos/cv444_9974.txt men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? 
pos/cv444_9974.txt men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt naturally nobody believes his story . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt  . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt  . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt james edwards no longer exists . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt meet agent jay . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . 
pos/cv444_9974.txt definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me !
