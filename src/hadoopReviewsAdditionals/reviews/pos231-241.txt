pos/cv467_25773.txt catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! 
pos/cv467_25773.txt initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's " losing my religion " ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . 
pos/cv467_25773.txt unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .

pos/cv061_8837.txt there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt return of the jedi has some interesting elements . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . 
pos/cv061_8837.txt congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .

pos/cv395_10849.txt

pos/cv395_10849.txt jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt arlo is not happy with his job . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt this is the situation when a new case comes knocking . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt however , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and 
pos/cv395_10849.txt this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt zero effect is weakest in its obviously " wacky " scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt however , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt but , on the whole , it is frustrating . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt bill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt and , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called " zero " seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . 
pos/cv395_10849.txt although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . 


pos/cv201_6997.txt

pos/cv201_6997.txt whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt this film camera is just another one of the guys . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt stay at home and rent up close and personal . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt and what's a buzz without tunes . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago . 
pos/cv201_6997.txt he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago .

pos/cv168_7050.txt larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt woody harrelson gives an excellent performance . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt althea had joined him in taking the drugs . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt edward norton plays flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt again , this is a solid performance . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt due to larry's character it is also , at times , a very funny film . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt however , it is much more than that . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story . 
pos/cv168_7050.txt keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey . 


pos/cv011_12166.txt

pos/cv011_12166.txt i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? 
pos/cv011_12166.txt more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . 
pos/cv011_12166.txt nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .

pos/cv431_7085.txt the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt  ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) 
pos/cv431_7085.txt this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . 
pos/cv431_7085.txt scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .

pos/cv278_13041.txt written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
pos/cv278_13041.txt directed by robert altman 
pos/cv278_13041.txt some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the only problem : the novel wasn't very good . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt it was far more pulp than pulitzer . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the director ? 
pos/cv278_13041.txt francis ford coppola . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
pos/cv278_13041.txt depends on whom you ask . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt >from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt this is what a great director can do for questionable source material . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? 
pos/cv278_13041.txt magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt and life is never so bad that it can't get worse . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? 
pos/cv278_13041.txt you be the judge . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but back to the picture at hand . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . 
pos/cv278_13041.txt and that , my friends , should make you very afraid . 


pos/cv179_9228.txt

pos/cv179_9228.txt no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like " the pied piper " ( passages of which are read during the film ) . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt i was half-right . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt nevertheless it's worth-seeing . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that " american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , " hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . 
pos/cv179_9228.txt though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter . 


pos/cv453_10379.txt

pos/cv453_10379.txt i was pleasantly surprised by this film . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt how much could you dress up the sets ? 
pos/cv453_10379.txt how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
pos/cv453_10379.txt how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
pos/cv453_10379.txt oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt titanic tells its story in two time periods . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt there she tells her story to lovett and his team . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( " steerage " , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt girls are going to swoon over him . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or " man " as they said at the turn of the century ) . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as " the unsinkable " molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt nice to see dr . bombay getting work . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending . 
pos/cv453_10379.txt in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .
