neg/cv335_16299.txt the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt alas , it refers to our heroes ! 
neg/cv335_16299.txt as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt but the human race doesn't have much to worry about . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! 
neg/cv335_16299.txt it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! 
neg/cv335_16299.txt virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt virus takes itself seriously . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt the leader , of course , is a big creature . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt on one level , virus is almost passable fun . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . 
neg/cv335_16299.txt in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .

neg/cv359_6751.txt like a good action film should , " metro " has action that keeps you involved . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt  " the ghost in the darkness , " which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt but " metro " is one of the best action films in a while . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt and this invites me to mention last year s " the nutty professor , " which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt  " metro " happens to be a lot better than any film in the " beverly hills cop " series . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt that is because " metro " takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt the " beverly hills cop " movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt in " metro " he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt his character in " metro " takes himself seriously . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in " metro , " and perhaps it is quite better off that way . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt  " metro " takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt cars flip . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt cars crash . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt cars turn over . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of " speed , " and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt there are also some other good scenes in " metro " that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt those are the scenes that make up " metro , " which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in " metro " was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt i hardly recognized him in " metro , " and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt the villain in " metro " is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in " kiss of death . " 
neg/cv359_6751.txt and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt i liked " metro , " and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt  " metro " is a no-nonsense movie . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt and it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt but who cares ? 
neg/cv359_6751.txt it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt oh , and there were plenty of explosions in " metro , " as well . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt if there is one major objection i had to " metro " , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . 
neg/cv359_6751.txt  " metro " is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end .

neg/cv857_17527.txt claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show . 
neg/cv857_17527.txt the story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come . 
neg/cv857_17527.txt by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast .

neg/cv962_9813.txt humanities quest for knowledge never ends . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt they agree to give him a ride to the next village . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt enjoy ! 
neg/cv962_9813.txt so much for the first attempt to catch her . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? 
neg/cv962_9813.txt our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt one by one she goes after the others . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt mostly we don't see the act of devouring . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the animatronics are somewhat more believable . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt but that didn't work for the strangling scenes . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt don't go see the movie for the f/x . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt they are everything but up-to-date . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? 
neg/cv962_9813.txt hard to say . 
neg/cv962_9813.txt this can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ?

neg/cv679_28221.txt  " pokemon 3 : the movie " has a lot of bad things in it . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is " pokemon : the johto journeys " so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt i'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don't understand what they are saying . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . . he 
neg/cv679_28221.txt sure did put me in my place . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt  " pokemon 3 : the movie " has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . 
neg/cv679_28221.txt for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow .

neg/cv910_21930.txt >from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt courtney is the " leader " of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt >from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as " tatum " , in 1996's scream . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt the beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt nothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt all in all , a horrible disappointment . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt the bottom line : the tagline reads , " even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . " 
neg/cv910_21930.txt yes , that is too true . 
neg/cv910_21930.txt no matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver . 


neg/cv977_4776.txt

neg/cv977_4776.txt i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment ! 
neg/cv977_4776.txt after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater ! 
neg/cv977_4776.txt read on to see what i have to say . . . . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt four rooms : 
neg/cv977_4776.txt starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt possible stars ) 
neg/cv977_4776.txt  " four rooms " was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt key word here : " supposed . " 
neg/cv977_4776.txt four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the movie was just plain trash . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt it was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film . 
neg/cv977_4776.txt the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals .

neg/cv127_16451.txt some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt gloria is her latest disaster . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice .

neg/cv127_16451.txt nobody . " 
neg/cv127_16451.txt most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse .

neg/cv127_16451.txt the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . 
neg/cv127_16451.txt think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? 
neg/cv127_16451.txt if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film .

neg/cv127_16451.txt when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , " you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . " 
neg/cv127_16451.txt gloria runs 1 : 48 .

neg/cv469_21998.txt hollywood never fails to astound me . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt i was truly convinced that " wild wild west " marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes " end of days " to prove me wrong . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt the result ? 
neg/cv469_21998.txt nothing but groans and yawns . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt at the very least , " end of days " should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt it's just lousy . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and " batman & robin , " plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from " friends " ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , " the chosen one , " their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt oh , the anguish ! 
neg/cv469_21998.txt oh , the humanity ! 
neg/cv469_21998.txt oh , the writing ! 
neg/cv469_21998.txt andrew w . marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first " lethal weapon , " preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt subtle , marlowe , subtle . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt what a guy . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but " end of days " is simply a flaccid special effects show . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt the cast is just as ineffective . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt that should count for something . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt way back in the aftermath " the exorcist " and " the omen , " supernatural swill like " end of days " might have passed muster as a b-movie . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt but that was then and this is now . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt  " the x-files " and " buffy the vampire slayer " deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on " the 700 club " and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt after enduring " end of days , " all i can say is " get thee behind me , satan . 
neg/cv469_21998.txt and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well . " 


neg/cv140_7963.txt

neg/cv140_7963.txt the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt cut batgirl out . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt cut one of the villains . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it's too much to handle in one dosage . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it's so much that characters get left behind . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and elle deserves better . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it's up to joel to make it fun though . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt  " batman forever " was fun . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i mean , this one bit . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
neg/cv140_7963.txt joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt end of her for all we know . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the trio must team together " as family " to beat them . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt there ya go . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt not the whole story but no big context clues . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt too much , right ? 
neg/cv140_7963.txt right ! 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt maybe some stunts . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt george is in between them . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 
neg/cv140_7963.txt arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt wow . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . " 
neg/cv140_7963.txt alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but in all fairness , she has virtually no part . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and poor elle . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt poor , poor elle . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but she has no part ! ! ! 
neg/cv140_7963.txt it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt in the original , it was with vicki . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this one , it's nothing . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . " 
neg/cv140_7963.txt fortunately , we get a lot of alfred . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's a god . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's a father figure . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's also dying . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this got to me . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but 
neg/cv140_7963.txt this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and there are some nice touches . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i laughed . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . " 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i laughed at all these . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or 
neg/cv140_7963.txt did it just feel like that ? 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt people are fed up with stupid films . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! " 
neg/cv140_7963.txt that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt i love the " batman " series . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt the first two rocked and i did like the last one . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt and michael keaton . 
neg/cv140_7963.txt but we can only hope .
