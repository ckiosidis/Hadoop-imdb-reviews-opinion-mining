neg/cv261_11855.txt while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the next element in the film is the part when things go awry . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world " is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt time passes . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and then there's martin sheen . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt but bruce wayne had human elements to him . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt none of this is present in spawn . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt children are not muppets . 
neg/cv261_11855.txt and spawn unapologetically targets children . 


neg/cv284_20530.txt

neg/cv284_20530.txt if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer's biggest pleasures . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt if only . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt in fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt take the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt after being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt but suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he's only injured . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ? 
neg/cv284_20530.txt apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ? 
neg/cv284_20530.txt having said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr . evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power's " mojo " ( don't you just love that word ? ) 
neg/cv284_20530.txt whilst he is cryogenically frozen . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt when austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley's vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt this sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt then there's mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a . . . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt petite clone of myer's dr . evil , exactly 1/8 in size . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt troyer's persona alone gains the film an extra half-star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini-mr . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt bigglesworth . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt just try to ignore the fact that , at 2'8'' , he would make dr . evil's height rise to just over 21 feet . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt no matter . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt however , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that just isn't enough to warrant even a minor recommendation . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt if there is in fact an " austin powers 3 " , they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr . evil and mini-me . 
neg/cv284_20530.txt unconventional , yes , but there's no denying that it'd make for a better movie . 


neg/cv647_15275.txt

neg/cv647_15275.txt the first in a very long list of things wrong with " i still know what you did last summer " is the title . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt think about it for a second . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt if the last movie was called " i know what you did last summer " , wouldn't the next movie have to be " i still know what you did two summers ago " ? 
neg/cv647_15275.txt if anyone working on this movie had an i . q . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , " hey . . . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt wait a minute " . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the " kind of " ) . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt first of all , i guess , is the setting . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? 
neg/cv647_15275.txt the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ? 
neg/cv647_15275.txt in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , " just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time . " 
neg/cv647_15275.txt oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt after all , it is in the script . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the " re-animator himself , jeffrey combs . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt way to go , jeffrey . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt with " scream " and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think " i still know " has really suffered by not having him on board . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two " scream " s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! " 
neg/cv647_15275.txt cliffhanger , he said " who is this time , the grandma ? " 
neg/cv647_15275.txt all in all , " i still know " tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . 
neg/cv647_15275.txt i mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . . 


neg/cv789_12991.txt

neg/cv789_12991.txt _dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt but as the trailer goes , " there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . " 
neg/cv789_12991.txt so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a 
neg/cv789_12991.txt heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? 
neg/cv789_12991.txt the answer is a resounding no . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt still , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . 
neg/cv789_12991.txt come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . 


neg/cv997_5152.txt

neg/cv997_5152.txt the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . 
neg/cv997_5152.txt there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . 


neg/cv232_16768.txt

neg/cv232_16768.txt shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt however , to directly quote the film , he has " cash flow problems . " 
neg/cv232_16768.txt through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt however , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt ironically , that couldn't be truer here . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt however , the supporting cast does almost save the day . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting . ) . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn't necessarily quality . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt and this certainly isn't quality . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . 
neg/cv232_16768.txt simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .

neg/cv500_10722.txt you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt why canadian ? 
neg/cv500_10722.txt who knows , eh ? 
neg/cv500_10722.txt along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt enter howie long . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of " ground pounders " , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt the script doesn't help him out any , however . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt long's co-stars are a mixed bag . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt that's not the case . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt there's a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we've 
neg/cv500_10722.txt seen this stuff before . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt however , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were . 
neg/cv500_10722.txt in fact , there's a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . .

neg/cv175_7375.txt capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt and nobody wins . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt let's stop and think about this for a second . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! 
neg/cv175_7375.txt someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . 
neg/cv175_7375.txt this movie bungles two out of three , badly . 


neg/cv392_12238.txt

neg/cv392_12238.txt i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt his cell , food and rights  all terrible . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .  
neg/cv392_12238.txt as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again . 
neg/cv392_12238.txt martin vailwhere are you ? 


neg/cv263_20693.txt

neg/cv263_20693.txt i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt wish me luck . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? 
neg/cv263_20693.txt enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it's stupid , pointless and repetitive . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt if that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt wait , maybe the only big laughs . . . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . 
neg/cv263_20693.txt but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck .
