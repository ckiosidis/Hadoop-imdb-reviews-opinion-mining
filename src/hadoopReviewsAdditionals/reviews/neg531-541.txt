neg/cv238_14285.txt first troy beyer wrote the critically panned " b . a . p . s . " 
neg/cv238_14285.txt now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt that is not the case here . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the script suffers from random plot developments . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question " where did that come from ? " 
neg/cv238_14285.txt at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt we've never seen her mother before . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt we never see her again . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt who cares ? 
neg/cv238_14285.txt what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt at another point , a character announces that she can't have children . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt apparently , this is devastating . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt but it does . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt first , it is original . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their " likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , " but on the whole , it's pretty bad . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt i'll give beyer one more strike , and then she's out . 
neg/cv238_14285.txt rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . 


neg/cv758_9740.txt

neg/cv758_9740.txt it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed " total recall " before this one ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and this includes keanu reeves . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt what do i hate about seagal ? 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold's hairpiece in " boogie nights . " 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt but the guy makes worse films than reagan did . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ? 
neg/cv758_9740.txt well . . . something 
neg/cv758_9740.txt about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ? 
neg/cv758_9740.txt so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and forsythe more than once threatens his family . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in " the shining " ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of " catch , " when he's conveniently called away on assignment . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i dunno about you , but playing " catch " with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he's unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt serves them right . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don't appear to be in this film . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i know this guy can act : he was awesome in " raising arizona " as goodman's partner in crime . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt but he's just awful here . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt why is he the only one who gives a good performance ? 
neg/cv758_9740.txt well , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt he seems to be in here just to give it a cool " law and order " feeling ( even if it's not a " cool " feeling ) . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as " terry malloy , " which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt oh ! 
neg/cv758_9740.txt and " er " 's julliana margiulles has two scenes . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt  " out for justice " just proves once again that american action films just suck . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don't bother watching this . 
neg/cv758_9740.txt it's so stupid that it's boring .

neg/cv706_25883.txt  " nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy " 
neg/cv706_25883.txt showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt some people , however , keep their clothes on . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt that's why this review will be short . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt there is no story , script , point or acting . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt only naked bodies , which is exactly the point . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt no one is twisting nomi's arm . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt no one is holding her grandmother hostage . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt she wants to do this . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt and that is what she is doing till the end credits . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt so what's the problem then ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt what's the point ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt what's the film about ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt  " i am not a whore ! 
neg/cv706_25883.txt i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt in fact the acting in " showgirls " brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it is a total waste of time and money . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt  " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . " 
neg/cv706_25883.txt well , excuse me ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it " show the naked truth " , is simplified and unreal . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt i see that you're hiding " - " from what ? " 
neg/cv706_25883.txt - " from you " . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt yes , and even the only decent line in this film : " nomi is what las vegas is all about " can't save 'showgirls' from going under . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it's a strange phenomena . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it's not erotic , because it lacks sensuality . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt not dramatic , because it lacks the acting . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt and not intelligent because it lacks a story . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt you want to see naked women ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt bare breasts ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt full frontals ? 
neg/cv706_25883.txt it's nothing wrong with that . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas' pathetic dialogue . 
neg/cv706_25883.txt b qualities , while it's only a high budget porn-film . 


neg/cv464_17076.txt

neg/cv464_17076.txt warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes 
neg/cv464_17076.txt director : luis mandoki 
neg/cv464_17076.txt screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) 
neg/cv464_17076.txt cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt review by : geoff berkshire 
neg/cv464_17076.txt i'm not an overly cynical guy . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt however , i have my limits and i also have standards . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt message in a bottle is one slow moving film . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the supporting players are given very little to do . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the reliable douglas is particularly wasted . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt there simply isn't an original scene in this film . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt this is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt he's simply going through the motions with this . 
neg/cv464_17076.txt message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . 


neg/cv365_12442.txt

neg/cv365_12442.txt welcome to your oh-so typical sequel . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt shallow . . . . hmm . . . now there's an idea . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the first thing that struck me . . . and 
neg/cv365_12442.txt surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet . . . . . . very 
neg/cv365_12442.txt different to the original movie . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the characters ? 
neg/cv365_12442.txt well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt why ? 
neg/cv365_12442.txt because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces . . . . bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt bang bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt jason patric ? 
neg/cv365_12442.txt all i can say is bring back keanu . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump . . . but 
neg/cv365_12442.txt that's one more tree stump than jason has . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
neg/cv365_12442.txt now frown ! . . . i said frown . . . . oh . . . you are . . . bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt bang bang . . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the bad guy . . . . . ahh . . . william 
neg/cv365_12442.txt dafoe - there's a bright move . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
neg/cv365_12442.txt  ( yes , that is sarcasm ) . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad . . . . but 
neg/cv365_12442.txt goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape . . . . bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt bang . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer . . . . bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt bang . . . . . was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was . . . . completely 
neg/cv365_12442.txt computer generated ! 
neg/cv365_12442.txt wow . . . . i 
neg/cv365_12442.txt don't think i've ever seen a cg model look so real before . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific , and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of . . . . speed . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt this lack-of-speed problem affects many sequences . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt such as the oil tanker part . . . . . it was - " oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! " , 
neg/cv365_12442.txt 20 minutes later - " oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! " 
neg/cv365_12442.txt 20 min . . . . you 
neg/cv365_12442.txt get the point . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt this movie failed simply because it didn't live up to it's name . . . . there 
neg/cv365_12442.txt was very little feeling of speed . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt in the original movie , the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive . . . . . in this movie it felt more like - " well people , we're gonna run into that there island in a few hours - i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i can't turn off the engines . . . i'm 
neg/cv365_12442.txt passing the cafeteria on the way , can i get anybody anything ? " 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the ending of this movie really is terrible . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt even though it features what i've since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie - it just doesn't work at all . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic , but . . . . surprise 
neg/cv365_12442.txt surprise - it just takes waaaaay too long . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town , around 25 people are killed by the ship . . . . and 
neg/cv365_12442.txt there's only 15 or so people left on the ship . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering - the audience is sitting back and thinking - " wait a sec . . . this is a happy moment because ? " 
neg/cv365_12442.txt bang bang 
neg/cv365_12442.txt then there was the dog . . . . . i 
neg/cv365_12442.txt almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche . . . . . . every 
neg/cv365_12442.txt movie seems to have a 'dog-in-danger' sequence - volcano , dante's peak , independence day , daylight , twister . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt lost world . . . . . . etc , 
neg/cv365_12442.txt etc . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel . 
neg/cv365_12442.txt director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back-to-back and see if he realises where he went wrong .

neg/cv138_13903.txt my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i love ralph fiennes . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i love uma thurman . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i love sean connery . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt this is a lousy , incoherent mess . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt this is just plain depressing . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i wasn't alive then . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i don't even watch television now . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt his name is de wynter ( connery ) . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt he is a crazy scottish guy . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt our heroes had better stop him , or else . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt  . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt  . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt and i guarantee you , it will wane . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt they aren't . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt they aren't , either . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt and what about this wasted cast ? 
neg/cv138_13903.txt oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i love the guy . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i've loved all his films , until this one . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt  ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) 
neg/cv138_13903.txt connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt who is to blame ? 
neg/cv138_13903.txt is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? 
neg/cv138_13903.txt perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt is it the actors ? 
neg/cv138_13903.txt for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt or a sense of purpose . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . 
neg/cv138_13903.txt damn this movie for not giving them the chance . 


neg/cv292_7804.txt

neg/cv292_7804.txt capsule : an insult . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt it's not even fun as trash . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt see if you can follow this . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the " money train " , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout " halt ! " 
neg/cv292_7804.txt and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt blam , the kid's dead . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and . . . i covered my face . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt i'd seen enough . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt we do not care about them . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they are not interesting . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt bullcrap . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt what exactly is this mess ? 
neg/cv292_7804.txt a cop movie ? 
neg/cv292_7804.txt police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt a thriller ? 
neg/cv292_7804.txt the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt a comedy ? 
neg/cv292_7804.txt the few jokes that do work are wasted . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt a drama ? 
neg/cv292_7804.txt all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt  ( actual dialogue excerpt : " fuck you . " 
neg/cv292_7804.txt  " what ? " 
neg/cv292_7804.txt  " you heard me : fuck * you * . " 
neg/cv292_7804.txt  " no : fuck * you * ! " ) 
neg/cv292_7804.txt look . i'll be honest here . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess , i'd get laughed out of the office . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better . 
neg/cv292_7804.txt i've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe . 


neg/cv992_12806.txt

neg/cv992_12806.txt synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , 
neg/cv992_12806.txt tramps about in the woods . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , 
neg/cv992_12806.txt leggings ) . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , 
neg/cv992_12806.txt as the earthquake slowly recedes . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt this movie is really stupid . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt she's of the " new people " ; they're of the " old people " with " the memories . " 
neg/cv992_12806.txt yep . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt we get it . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt we get it . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt this movie also suffers from its new age trappings . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . 
neg/cv992_12806.txt i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . 


neg/cv105_19135.txt

neg/cv105_19135.txt based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt can you say . . . the 
neg/cv105_19135.txt third times not a charm ? 
neg/cv105_19135.txt plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt when you consider that the other " part " of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this " big " summer blockbuster .

neg/cv105_19135.txt a bad movie is a bad movie . 
neg/cv105_19135.txt on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .

neg/cv105_19135.txt then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh
