pos/cv887_5126.txt the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! 
pos/cv887_5126.txt he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt like wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the movie also offers a provocative look at technology . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? 
pos/cv887_5126.txt is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt wang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt griffith . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt mason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt for instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . 
pos/cv887_5126.txt you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .

pos/cv428_11347.txt on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt on that fateful night , the titanic sunk . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt now , more than 50 years later , a film has been made . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt and what a film that is . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt james cameron's newest movie is a landmark in storytelling , emotion , and special effects . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt it starts in the present , where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship's wreckage . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt exploring an old chest , paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt the drawing is televised and the woman ( gloria stuart ) whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely , the ship's story is told . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson , a young man with a sketch book , a heart of gold , an intelligent mind , and not much else . he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game , and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt she grows to love jack , but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance' , cal hockley ( billy zane ) . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt the film takes its time , and by doing so , makes us care about its characters , and shows us the full aspects of human emotion . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt the leads shine ; there is no bad performance ; in fact , these do not seems like performances at all , but genuine people , trapped on the doomed vessel , facing certain death . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt watching this film , i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel : the time rose and jack spend together at a third-class-party ; the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude ; the terror felt by all onboard , as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt this , the most expensive movie ever made , $200 million , is destined to make its profit back , and then some . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year . . even this decade . 
pos/cv428_11347.txt it is also yet another first : the first $200 million dollar romance , and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed , money extremely . . very 
pos/cv428_11347.txt  . . well 
pos/cv428_11347.txt spent . 


pos/cv885_12318.txt

pos/cv885_12318.txt when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt an all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great " conjunction " of three suns . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt as well , trevor jones' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn't be helped , but i wish the film was longer . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt jen and kira have wonderful . . . well , 
pos/cv885_12318.txt chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the dark crystal has a very small cult following . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of " the muppet show " with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien's fan-base . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt  ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) 
pos/cv885_12318.txt the dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt it's the best kind of children's entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip . 
pos/cv885_12318.txt brian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father's masterpiece . 


pos/cv210_9312.txt

pos/cv210_9312.txt i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt breakdown , then , is something of a surprise . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt j . t . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . 
pos/cv210_9312.txt one of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time . 


pos/cv286_25050.txt

pos/cv286_25050.txt according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word " amarcord " is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase " i remember " in local italian dialect . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . 
pos/cv286_25050.txt that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

pos/cv385_29741.txt capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .

pos/cv385_29741.txt how much did he know about crimes against humanity ? 
pos/cv385_29741.txt the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt  , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pos/cv385_29741.txt in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt we are given clues to something but they are never tied up . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt the film is basically a stage play . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt the visual is not very important . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . 
pos/cv385_29741.txt at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say " jan 16 tues . " 
pos/cv385_29741.txt a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .

pos/cv365_11576.txt for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
pos/cv365_11576.txt that is endlessly refreshing . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story .

pos/cv365_11576.txt eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt he really likes her , but she's engaged . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt you know the story . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt you've seen it a million times before . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt and sometimes , it works . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt the wedding singer works . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt second , their love is mature . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt i liked it in spite of the soundtrack . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt often , the music and references felt forced . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to " get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . " 
pos/cv365_11576.txt  ( ha ha ha . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt get it ? 
pos/cv365_11576.txt david lee roth did leave van halen ! ) 
pos/cv365_11576.txt or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt  ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt that's not to say the movie isn't funny . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . 
pos/cv365_11576.txt with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong . 


pos/cv800_12368.txt

pos/cv800_12368.txt those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt i haven't even seen that . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . 
pos/cv800_12368.txt however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . 


pos/cv369_12886.txt

pos/cv369_12886.txt sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt time alone will make that call . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt the soundstage , we're told , is " only the second man-made structure visible from space . " 
pos/cv369_12886.txt truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : " people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . " 
pos/cv369_12886.txt nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , " i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . " 
pos/cv369_12886.txt but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? 
pos/cv369_12886.txt ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt what does god really think of us ? 
pos/cv369_12886.txt does he resent our abandonment of paradise ? 
pos/cv369_12886.txt who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? 
pos/cv369_12886.txt if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be . 
pos/cv369_12886.txt he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . 


pos/cv059_28885.txt

pos/cv059_28885.txt the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt all in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt but first the basics . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! " ) 
pos/cv059_28885.txt farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that'll do , donkey . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt that'll do " ) to " the graduate . " 
pos/cv059_28885.txt but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " 
pos/cv059_28885.txt  ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like " it's a small world . " 
pos/cv059_28885.txt which brings me to disturbing point number one . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! 
pos/cv059_28885.txt put the past behind you ! 
pos/cv059_28885.txt there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt beyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt adding short jokes is simply mean . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt still , " shrek " is a rollicking good time . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt to trot out a clich ? , " shrek " is fun for all ages . 
pos/cv059_28885.txt parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .
