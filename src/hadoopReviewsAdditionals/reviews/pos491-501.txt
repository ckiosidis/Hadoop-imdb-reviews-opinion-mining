pos/cv496_10530.txt when quentin tarantino made " pulp fiction " , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to " citizen kane " , hear me out . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt much like " citizen kane " , " pulp fiction " has changed movie making forever . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt but i think the latter has had a tad more impact . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt  " pulp fiction " has actually ushered in a new era of film making . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt it has altered the way films will be viewed . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt  " fiction " has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt sure , some have been excellent ( " bound " and " the usual suspects " spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes " pulp fiction " as the original neo-noir of the 90s . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic ) . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the " quarter pounder with cheese " speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the first , titled " vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife " , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt they talk for a while ( with the occasional " uncomfortable silence " ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a " speech impediment " . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic " you never can tell " . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the " die hard " flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous " gimp " scene , which is very reminicent of the " squeal like a pig ! " 
pos/cv496_10530.txt scene from " deliverance " . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt they end up calling a " cleaner " of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt that version cut out , like , half the movie . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt just a theory . . . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt  " psycho " " kiss me deadly " , " deliverance " , etc . ) . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt but why shouldn't he ? 
pos/cv496_10530.txt it's not like he out-right and blatantly stole . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt give the guy a break . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt in case you haven't already noticed , i believe " pulp fiction " is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as " casablanca " and " the godfather " ) . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt trust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt and besides , it's one hell of a ride . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt note : if anyone knows how i could get a " bad motherfucker " wallet , please e-mail me . 
pos/cv496_10530.txt any help would be greatly appreciated .

pos/cv240_14336.txt seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt [theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
pos/cv240_14336.txt  " rounders " is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt and to take make things " worse " it proves this through its original , fascinating story . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the " noir " mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt we learn only a little about mike , both past and present . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder " worm " ( norton ) is released from prison . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the " good " kid's " bad " friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt sometimes they pay off ( i . e . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? 
pos/cv240_14336.txt if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt everything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . 
pos/cv240_14336.txt what separates " rounders " from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . 


pos/cv024_6778.txt

pos/cv024_6778.txt call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , " do you expect the world to stop . . . just 
pos/cv024_6778.txt because you picked _today_ to clean up ? " 
pos/cv024_6778.txt the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt oh , the irony of it . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch " helping " spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . 
pos/cv024_6778.txt the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . 


pos/cv529_10420.txt

pos/cv529_10420.txt seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt if there's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt and if there's ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , " tomorrow never dies " is it . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt opening sequences almost always make or break action films . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt first there's a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt there's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt when the scene ends in tragedy , it's clear there's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? 
pos/cv529_10420.txt the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt he single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! 
pos/cv529_10420.txt this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape , instead , it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term " villain " sounds passe ) . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt the film's hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . 
pos/cv529_10420.txt although " tomorrow never dies " is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . 


pos/cv260_13959.txt

pos/cv260_13959.txt  " a breed apart " casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt a bit hard to swallow ? 
pos/cv260_13959.txt that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt turner is the woman caught between the two men . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt  " a breed apart " isn't a bad movie , exactly . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at " his " birds . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt and this one is no exception . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt he comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt soon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us . 
pos/cv260_13959.txt  " a breed apart " isn't a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it's worth seeing for that reason alone . 


pos/cv402_14425.txt

pos/cv402_14425.txt in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt the duo must always be completely mismatched . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt however , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt still , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt jackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt or , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt despite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt chris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt however , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt when he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt chris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt since he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt while not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt lee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) 
pos/cv402_14425.txt when contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . 
pos/cv402_14425.txt as well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star .

pos/cv732_12245.txt modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt liam neeson stars as jean valjean . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt two women also get caught up in the struggle . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the supporting cast is also extraordinary . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . 
pos/cv732_12245.txt it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . 


pos/cv246_28807.txt

pos/cv246_28807.txt  " the tailor of panama " is a different kind of spy movie . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt osnard offers harry a way out . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt osnard turns in reports about the " silent opposition , " a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt the metropolis , described by one character as " casablanca without heroes " pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . 
pos/cv246_28807.txt  " the tailor of panama " succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . 


pos/cv826_11834.txt

pos/cv826_11834.txt there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt based on the book written by " anonymous " ( actually former " newsweek " writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt but he doesn't actually play stanton . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign's eccentric " tougher than dirt " incriminator . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt at occasions , you can't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ? 
pos/cv826_11834.txt most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public's opinion . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is . 
pos/cv826_11834.txt thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it's scary . 


pos/cv471_16858.txt

pos/cv471_16858.txt a costume drama set in the 1500s , england , elizabeth is a lush , romantic , political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens , the royal family , so to speak , are upset that a protestant should be crowened , and not another catholic , plus , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchette ) , was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary's father . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt the persecution over catholics and protestants isn't the only majority in elizabeth . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures , and her lover ( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love ) , in order to rule , successfully , the country , which she did for 40 more years . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both feature a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench plays her in love ) , or course . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt yet , i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love , not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i , but because i found blanchette a more powerful , hypnotic sense for the role . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt elizabeth , also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough , is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt it's a dynamic , important , breathtaking film of loyalty , power , greed , and trust . 
pos/cv471_16858.txt shakespeare would die for the book rights .
